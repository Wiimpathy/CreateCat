      <title>Android Attack</title>
      <genre>Shooter</genre>
      <synopsis>Android Attack is a 32 K update of the Berzerk clone Robot Battle for 16K Tandy Colour systems. The extra memory is used to add in another feature of the original arcade game, namely speech, which is portrayed in its Microdeal title, Talking Android Attack.As in Berzerk, you are a lone humanoid in a large complex with lots of maze-like rooms. Your objective is to survive, and earn points by exterminating all the hostile robots that inhabit the complex. Shooting a robot (before it shoots you) turns it into a heap of deadly scrap, which will reanimate after a short while, though not into the android it once was, but into a ghost. The ghosts can pass through walls and try to fulfill the mission of their former life. This is a slight deviation from the original Berzerk, where the ghost was a separate character called "Evil Otto". Another difference is that in this version, you can jump and duck to avoid robot bullets.Another peril in the game is the walls, which are electrified. By sacrificing an energy unit, of which you need at least three, you can opening up a hole in the wall to pass through. On each screen there is also a crown, which can be picked up for 100 points. Killing an android gives 50 points, and killing its ghost gives you another 100. By eliminating all enemies and picking up the crown and exiting the room, you are granted a bonus sum calculated from the remaining time (when it reaches zero, you are killed). For every 10 000 points, you earn another energy unit. If you leave the room without having killed the enemies, the computer will say in wobbly 6-bit speech, "Coward!".</synopsis>

      <genre>Action</genre>
      <synopsis>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lazers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>You are a robber, whose goal is to collect bags of money in each of the three scenes and dump them in your wheelbarrow, while avoiding miners and moving railcars. You can deal with the miners by using a pickaxe to knock them unconscious for a few seconds. If you are trying collect a money bag but a railcar gets in your way, you can cling onto the ceiling while it passes by. If you drop off the handholds on the ceiling at the right time, you can also ride the railcar to avoid the miners.Once you do collect all the bags of money in one scene, you simply move your wheelbarrow to the next scene. In fact, you can go between the 3 scenes at will; you do not have to collect all the money bags in one scene in order to proceed to the next. In the last two scenes, you have to use elevators to get from Point A to Point B. Be warned: you can only carry one money bag at a time, and the weight of the bag makes you move slowly, making it a lot easier for miners to catch you. Also remember that time is against you, but if you manage to dump a bag in the wheelbarrow, you are given more time.
    There is a special money bag (worth more points) inside a blocked off room, in the middle screen. You need the pickaxe to break through the wall to get it, but it is very heavy, and slows you down much more than a regular money bag.</synopsis>

Once all items are picked up a ladder to the next level is introduced. The screen is guarded by nasties such as mice, worms or spiders, which vary according to the level. They can be stopped in their path by digging a hole in the ground for them to fall into.The game features 60 screens, runs in monochrome high resolution and has a (password-protected) level editor.</synopsis>

While jumping around, you must watch our for the baddies on the screen. The "black" and "red" (their colour changes depending on platform and colour settings) blobs will just jump downwards until they leave the playfield and rematerialise at the top again, while the evil spring can jump in any directions and will hunt poor Blochead all over the place. Luckily, there are two teleport squares outside the normal blocks which you can use to teleport back to your home block.</synopsis>

      <genre>Action</genre>
      <synopsis>After a successful Pitfall clone, Tom Mix published a Joust clone for the CoCo and Dragon. Just as in the original Joust, you are a knight, riding an ostrich in a dungeon tournament(!). The goal is to force the ostrich to fly onto the platform and to land on your opponents. The opponent ostriches turn into eggs when landed upon, for you to collect. When all opponents are eliminated, you go on to the next level. If you wait too long, a dangerous pterodactyl will enter the screen to chase you down. Buzzard Bait is mostly feature-complete compared to its role model, including lava trolls. To cope with the limited colour repertoire of the Motorola 6847 chip, you can choose between three colour schemes for the game, ranging from the system green and "buff" to a pure black and white mode.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The objective of Catchem is to catch all falling objects. Each level features a different object falling. When any object is missed, you lose a live, and your paddle, which you use to catch the objects, shrinks with one paddle. When a 'bad object' like a lightning is catched, you also lose a live. You can re-win this live, but you can't have more lives than your 3 starting lives. Subsequent levels get more and more difficult simply because of the speed. Each four levels, a bonus level appears where you may or may not avoid all objects: it's simply for points.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Meteoroids is another Asteroids clone. You fly your spaceship around a screen filled with asteroids, and shoot them into smaller and smaller pieces until they are destroyed. If you get in trouble, you can hit the emergency teleport button and end up somewhere else on the screen.What makes Meteoroids deviate from the norm is its control system. Instead of the usual Asteroids system, where you turn your ship around its axis and accelerate by pressing forward, this game uses two analogue joysticks. The first joystick simply pushes the ship in whichever direction you push the joystick. Since the control is analogue, you have a fair amount of fine control over both thrust and direction. The second joystick controls the direction of your cannon in a similar fashion. This poses a new challenge to Asteroids fans.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>This is the first commercial clone of Taito's Space Invaders for the Tandy Colour, and subsequently the Dragon. Its behaviour is almost exactly that of the original, with rows of aliens moving slowly in a zig-zag pattern across the screen, downwards to the player which can only move left and right. The player has three barriers to hide behind, but these are gradually worn down by alien shots. An additional small barrier can be moved around to cover the player as well. From time to time, a UFO worth extra points will cross the top of the screen. Fifteen difficulty levels are available.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Crystle Castles, or Ice Castles as it is also known, is a straight copy of Atari's Crystal Castles. Your hero must pick upp all the dots (crystals) spread around the isometric castle-like mazes guarded by deadly creatures. The concept is a bit like a three-dimensional Pac-man. Some paths and platforms require you to take a lift to reach them, and some levels also have tunnels between different parts of the screen. The tunnels are a source of confusion, since you can still see your character as in plain daylight while traversing the tunnel. Most levels are picked straight from the Atari original, though notably lacking the opening maze where the landscape spelt out the name of the company whose intellectual property was being infringed upon.</synopsis>

Using the axe, he can pick holes in the floor that the creeps fall into. Trapped in the holes, they are defenceless against Cuthbert's axe.

      <synopsis>In this installment of the Cuthbert Saga, Cuthbert goes for a stroll on a grid. As he walks along all four sides of a cell in a grid, it changes color, and when all cells have been coloured, it is on to the next grid. This would have been too easy, were it not for the nasties that also walk along the grid. Cuthbert's only weapons are his wits and his ability to jump over the nasties. Just try not to jump out of the screen! The inspiration for this game is the old arcade game, Amidar, and it can be seen as a primitive version of Oh Mummy.</synopsis>

You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</synopsis>

      <genre>Shooter</genre>
      <synopsis>Devil Assault is, as the name implies, based on Imagic's popular Demon Attack, a frantic fixed-screen shooter.The game is played in waves:
The first wave is the bombing wave. Three monstrous space birds fly around and shoot at you. Whenever you shoot one, it regenerates, until their ranks are sufficiently diminished.
After that comes another bombing wave.
The robot wave is similar, but with robots with more intricate movement patterns. You must not let your trigger finger rest here, because the robots will try to walk down beside you where you cannot hit them with your bullets.
The sproings level feature enemies who jump up and down on the screen. Let them not jump into you.
Like many other primitive shoot'em'ups (though this one is otherwise much less primitive than many others), you have only one bullet on screen at any time, and it follows your ship to the left and right. This turns out to be a major part of the gameplay, since it alters the way you calculate the right moment to fire and even lets you criss-cross your bullet between enemies in order to hit those higher up.</synopsis>

His job in produce involves catching fruits as they are thrown at him and placing them in the correct basket. At the toy store he must sort items by shape and colour, and be careful with the security switch.

      <synopsis>Donkey King is one of those shameless Donkey Kong clones, for systems that never received an official port. For those that don't know Nintendo's original, it is the first game where Mario appears, and one of the earliest platformers. On each level, high up on a building site, Mario must climb his way up to the big ape and free a damsel in distress. The giant ape throws obstacles which Mario must avoid, in addition to the hostile environment containing fires and conveyor belts. Donkey King has all the stages of the original Donkey Kong, known here as the Barrels, Pins, Jacks and Conveyor screens. It has even retained the cut scenes and the hair style of Mario's beloved.A feature unique to this version is the option to play in three different colour modes: green, buff or black and white.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Doodle Bug is a clone of the arcade game, Lady Bug, itself a close relative of the original Pac-Man. Just like the yellow pill-eater, you guide your sprite around a maze populated by nasties, and can only escape once you've eaten all the pills in the maze. A baddie in the centre of the screen will spawn a new baddie every time the running meter on the score panel has reached zero.The powerup system does not work like Pac-Man, though. No invincibility pills are available, instead, there are a number of letters from the words "special" and "extra" displayed at the top of the screen. When the letters are the same colour as the words they belong to, you begin to spell out those words, granting you either a "special" round or an "extra" life. Additionally, the heart bonuses act as score multipliers for your pills.Without any power pills, your bug is quite vulnerable. Therefore, the environment must be used to its advantage. Many walls in the Doddle Bug maze function like revolving doors which, when passed, will rotate to block the path of a baddie that could otherwise hunt you down.</synopsis>

Difficulty is increased by falling acid, Indiana Jones meets Donkey Kong style runaway boulders and a time limit upon which expiration means death by a flying bat. Backtracking is required which some perceived as tedious while others saw a logical expansion upon the relatively limited amount of ten caverns. Upon completion of the ten caverns, the player starts over at the beginning at a more difficult level, where the acid drops are closer to the ropes, requiring one to "hang" off the opposite edge to avoid being hit by them.</synopsis>

Mario must run across all rivets in a scaffolding in order to loosen the structure so that it eventually falls down, taking the "Munkey" with itself. The structure is filled with wandering flames which must be avoided. A bonus item in the shape of a fire extinguisher can be used to put out the flames, but it only works for a short while and disables jumps and ladder climbing.The second screen is a combination of two original screens, namely the "barrels" and "lifts" screens, where Dunkey throws barrels down the platforms and Mario must take the lift to reach the kidnapped girl. This screen is reached only after clearing the first screen twice.The Dragon version runs in four-colour mode, whereas the CoCo version uses the NTSC artifact mode for a colour set that better matches that of the original.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>If there were any doubt as to the quality of Flight Simulator II, it should be dispelled by the knowledge that SubLOGIC went to the FAA for approval of its use in flight training.  Whether or not they actually got the approval—remember this was 1984, and such application of personal computers was new ground—they attempted to create a realistic flight simulator.This flight simulator simulates a real aircraft, the Piper PA-23-181 Archer II.  For those with the knowledge, it offers practice with the variables of flight, including the avionics. The Atari ST-release (1986), instead, simulates the Cessna 182 single engine propeller aircraft and the Gates Learjet 25G twin engine jet. The simulator was considered to be a second generation product.  It had many more features than first generation flight simulators, and pilots were expected to pay attention to small details.  SubLOGIC encouraged the users of the game to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program.  The game was oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there were options for non pilots too: the company included an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode.  These modes did not require the same level of knowledge.Flight Simulator II was also packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace.  In this game your plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen.  The radar screen is anachronistic for a game set in World War I, but it is there to help gameplay.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Galax Attax is a clone of Namco's Galaxian, which was one of the first shoot'em'ups to deviate from the original Space Invaders fare in favor of things such as aliens with individual behavior and movement.Your goal: Shoot down all the aliens as they fly in formation. If they break free from their formation and fly at you, they are worth twice as many points, while also being more dangerous.On the Tandy computer, the game uses NTSC artifacting for colour on a black space backdrop, whereas the Dragon version has been reprogrammed with a white backdrop, which makes the orange bullets harder to see, resulting in an overall more difficult game. The Tandy version was later reprogrammed with new sprites which looked more like the insect-themed ones from the original Galaxian instead of the more abstract ones of the first version.</synopsis>

As in Lode Runner, you mission is to steal all of the gold bars, while avoiding the guards, and escape up to the next level after you have gotten them all. Guards can pick up to 1 Gold bar themselves, and the only way to get them back is to dig a self filling hole in the ground (on ground that you can actually dig in) early enough that it kills the guard. If you dig it to late, the guard will crawl out on his own (something you can not do if you get in the same situation). The game takes on strategy and maze play as well, as some of the gold bars are buried inside walls that you have to dig through to get to them.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Ice Master is another early Pengo clone. Your small man runs around in a landscape filled with blocks of ice and populated by insects. Your only goal is to crush the insects by pushing ice blocks at them. You can only push one block at a time. Trying to push a block that is blocked by another block will instead destroy the block so that you can push the one behind it. All insects must be crushed before you can go on to the next level, which is made more difficult by the fact that they respawn, so killing all in a quick succession is required. Bonus score is calculated based on how much time is used. The game runs in black and white high resolution mode, with artifact colour on NTSC machines.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>You are code-named Orion, an adolescent agent of ACT (the Adventure Connection Team), summoned straight out of the hallways of your high school by Max Huntington to participate in a mission taking you to the darkest jungles of Africa, to locate and defuse the limitless energies stored in an alien artifact there before sinister competing agents of BRUTE (the Bureau of Random Unlawful Terror and Evil) beat you to it!Other members of your team include an archaeologist ("Digger"), an environmental scientist ("Erda"), a nuclear engineer ("Celeste") and Olano, your guide.  You, of course, are the computer expert, and your skills will be put to the test, typing in included BASIC programs to decrypt secret messages, weigh tolerances, plot courses through labyrinths and calculate necessary angles of deflection.  The abilities of the whole team will be called for to overcome natural obstacles, untrusting natives, the sapping effects of the Devorim Force, BRUTE agents, a traitor in your midst, the perils and traps of the golden lost city containing the artifact, and the deadly artifact itself!Though the story shares the dynamic 2nd-person perspective ("You try to talk, but you cannot make a sound") of Choose-Your-Own-Adventures, the text (like most books) is a non-interactive fixed-rail trip of zero interactivity -- however, some of the type-in programs included offer numerous outcomes, moving into the "game" field what might otherwise be best categorized as an elaborate set-up for low-impact programming exercises.An appendix is included describing how to modify the BASIC program listings for greatest compatibility with 10 of the most popular home microcomputer BASICs, as well as describing what each program does and how it works.  Hey!  You got your education in my adventure!</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Junior's Revenge is a feature-complete clone of Donkey Kong Jr.. All four stages of the original are present.Junior, son of a monkey, must free his father from the evil Luigi (this was right before Mario Bros was released, so the naming of the character was an effort to avoid infringing on Mario, even though the name wound up being used for his brother straight thereafter). This he must do by climbing up and down vines and jumping between platforms, avoiding the fish-like creatures that run up and down the vines. On later screens, he must climb chains to push locks into position so that the cage holding his father is opened. Fruits can be found hanging on the vines and chains, which can be picked up for points, upon which they drop, eliminating any enemies unfortunate enough to be positioned underneath.The game runs in artifact mode on Tandy computers, and with the usual three colour selections on a Dragon.</synopsis>

      <title>Klendathu</title>
      <synopsis>Based on Robert A. Heinlein's Hugo-award winning book, Starship Troopers, this game simulates the brief combat life in M.I. (Mobile Infantry) far in the future. The Terran Federation is locked in a deadly war with "the Bugs," and has announced "Operation Bughouse," an attack directly on the Bugs' home world of Klendathu. Equipped with a state-of-the-art power suit, you drop in from orbit and and torch as many Bug warriors as possible, then bounce back out before your suit runs out of energy or the Bugs overwhelm you. Survive three drops and you can retire, with pay based on how many Bugs of each rank you blasted.

Game play consists of carefully selecting which block of the drop zone to land in, and then blasting the warrior and queen Bugs as they advance down the screen toward you. For each warrior and queen you might see, however, there are many more harmless worker Bugs, which look exactly like the warriors. They're all swarming toward you; choose your targets carefully and don't waste your ammo. You'll know the warriors because they're the ones shooting at you.</synopsis>

It is a near-perfect replica (given the limitations of the hardware) of the moon-driving, jumping, shooting arcade game. Like the original, it has both beginner and expert courses where you drive your four-wheel (this is one small difference) moon-car on the rocky surface of the moon. While your suspension takes care of most of the terrain, there are some rough spots. You must jump across the craters and above the moon-rocks. And as if that wasn't enough, there are attacking aliens. You must shoot these down with your guns, one pointing in your driving direction and one overhead.</synopsis>

It is Mickey's job to travel to each planet and locate the crystals so the inhabitants of the planet Oron may receive their memory back. Information about the different planets and locations visited are displayed on arrival, and XL30 may occasionally give clues through the ships computer. The interface for the game doesn't use a text parser, instead short sentences are created by using the cursor keys to highlight the necessary words from a selection on the screen. The game will also suggest better options if an illogical or impossible action is requested.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Microchess, a chess-playing program for microcomputers, has been described as the first commercially successful game for home computers, initially programmed in 1976 on MOS Technology's KIM-1.Designed for homebrew kit hobbyists to plug into less than 1k of memory, what the play algorithms lack in grandmaster talent they make up for in speed.  Marginally upgraded (the TRS-80 version expanded to 4k: 2k for game logic and 2k for a picture of a chess board) for the burgeoning microcomputer market (why restrict input and output to a hex keyboard and 6 LED digit displays if you don't have to?) it went on to sell over a million copies for the Apple 2 and TRS-80 (and, among the usual suspects, also eventually ported to other hobby platforms such as those made by "Processor Technology, Imsai, Cromemco, Polymorphic Systems, MITS, Ohio Scientific, and many more") before quickly being overtaken by the likes of Sargon.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Monkey Kong, or as it was dubbed by MicroDeal, King Cuthbert, is yet another Donkey Kong clone (of course). Two screens from the original are present in this version. The first is the classic first "barrels" screen, where the Mario-like character must climb a scaffolding and jump over the barrels that Monkey Kong rolls toward him. In the level are also two hammers, which Mario/Cuthbert can use to smash the barrels. Wielding the hammer makes him unable to jump and climb ladders, though.The second screen is the "rivets" screen, where you must climb the ladders of another scaffolding that is on fire. Avoid the fires and pop the rivets that hold the platforms together. Once they are all popped, the scaffolding will collapse and take the monkey with itself.Graphically, Monkey Kong is not as blatant a copy as Donkey King, but still makes no effort to mask Mario as anything else but Mario (or Cuthbert). The game runs in four-colour mode.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Essentially a clone of Moon Patrol, Moon Hopper is a speedy scrolling game where you control an armed moon buggy, rolling across a moon surface guarded by lots of aliens. Unlike Moon Patrol, you can't control the angle of the cannon mounted on the roof, instead simply firing upwards at all times, with another gun pointing forward. Apart from the aliens, you also have craters to worry about, which must be jumped across, and junk getting in your way, which can be shot with your other cannon.The scrolling is variable, which means that you can speed up your vehicle to avoid enemy fire. A meter at the bottom shows how far along a level you have come.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Based on the 1981 Nichibutsu Arcade game. 
Aliens have invaded our asteroid belt! It's up to you to get rid of them. 
Your space ship on the bottom of the vertically scrolling screen dodges and shoots at asteroids, hostile ships and the like. 
By moving left and right and firing rapidly, first you must clear a path through the asteroids. Only then you can take on the alien craft. Pushing up on the joystick increases speed, but crashing into an asteroid means death. A bonus is awarded if you pass through unscathed. Once on the other side, the aliens attack from the top and sides of the screen and drop  missiles. The first wave is just a teaser. Progressive waves are more aggressive and harder to kill. If you destroy a certain number of aliens, more asteroids must be avoided or destroyed, followed by yet another alien attack, and so on, until eventually all are defeated or you have no more lives.</synopsis>

      <title>Ninja Warrior</title>
      <genre>Fighting</genre>
      <synopsis>Ninja Warrior is a basic side scrolling jump and shoot game, similar in concept to Moon Patrol. The difference, of course, being that you are a Ninja, and you are crushing rocks, spearing fireballs, deflecting arrows, etc. The game runs it's title and option selection screens in a semi-graphics mode, so you can't see the whole screen on a Coco 3, but the main gameplay is in a "normal" mode which runs fine on all Coco's.The game's levels are based on your belt color (like real martial arts have), and as you progress, you go up through the belt ranks (white, yellow, 2nd level yellow, etc.). Each level also introduces a new "opponent" to worry about, and combinations of "opponents" that you have encountered in the earlier levels. Some examples from the early levels are: White Belt - Rocks, and occasional holes in the ground; Yellow - adds stationary fireballs on the ground; 2nd level Yellow belt - adds fireballs being flung at you from off screen, and many more as you progress up into the black belt ranks.While the graphics are decidedly lo-resolution (128x96x4, to help the game fit into 16K RAM), the game play is actually a lot of fun, especially when you reach higher levels for the first time and you have no idea what new surprise you will encounter next.</synopsis>

      <genre>Puzzle</genre>
      <synopsis>An original game, Panic Button involved one working on a multi-level manufacturing line, trying to keep up orders by assembling various products. The parts drop out of 3 chutes on the top left of the playfield, and you can run all over the place to pick up the 3 different parts of the product, and you have to assemble them in order (for example, a robot must have it's feet on the bottom, torso in the middle, and head on the top). The pieces come out of the first conveyor belt in random order, and you can only carry one piece at a time. If you accidentally assemble a product in the wrong order, it becomes useless, so you have to careful where you drop the pieces. There is also a Panic Button (hence the game name) in the upper right corner that you can hit that stops the conveyor belts temporarily.
For each level, you have to make a specific amount of the product you are creating within a time limit of 2 minutes, and each successive level gets faster and faster (and you also have to build more and more). Also, since the 3 conveyor belts are staggered, and pieces will drop on their own between them, you have to be careful watching them as they get near a drop point, as they could fall on pieces you have already constructed and potentially screw that particular product up. On later levels, the bad products start bouncing around as well, interfering with your manoeuvring.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>An arcade style game with a loose basis on the arcade hit Defender, Protector II is a side-scrolling shooter. Like Defender, there are lots of different aliens to contend with, and some ground based enemies as well. There are no smart bombs, however. You have to rescue humans as well (twice) from both an alien ship, and later a city that will be overrun with lava from a volcano that erupts during the game; all the while protecting them from aliens. You then have to drop them one at a time (unlike Defender, you can only carry one human at a time) into a teleporter tube to get them off the planet entirely.
   The game is quite difficult, with some very precise flying required at times (probably even more difficult than Defender or Stargate). It also has more of a "plot" than the arcade games it is based on, with several sub-missions of rescue depending on what stage you are at (it should be noted that there is no breaks between "stages" - the whole game play is continuous).</synopsis>

      <synopsis>As Tal, your job is to single-handedly clear out the aliens who have invaded a desolate and destroyed post-nuclear earth. To have any chance of this, he must locate a sacred suit of armor. Not only will this protect him from radiation, and allow him to withstand some enemy contact, it also heals him, and enables him to float.

This means that the game has two distinct styles, with your character limited to jumping, and with only rocks (located around the screens) to throw. Once he finds the suit he can fly around the ledges, shoot the inbuilt Pulsar beam, and survive within the volcanic hideout the aliens have based themselves. You will need to recharge the suit at times, and also take it off to pass through tight caverns.</synopsis>

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets).

In the dazzling future of the late 1990's, the world's first fusion reactor is online: energy particles are shooting out of emission tubes toward the energy posts... and missing. As each one passes the posts and strikes another tube on the opposite side of the core, the reactor moves one step closer to meltdown. The reflectoid is there; that's the solid energy deflection device which bounces the particles into the posts. It's supposed be remotely controlled by a sophisticated network of computers, but tonight it has to be controlled by you!</synopsis>

The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</synopsis>

The submarine is armed with missiles, torpedoes, and a 'Big Kill' weapon (this affects everything onscreen) to help in your mission. The air supply is limited, so when possible you will need to surface to replenish your air supply. </synopsis>

      <synopsis>Shanghai is a tile-based game based on the ancient Chinese game of Mah-Jong - this was the first of many computer versions.The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on, as well as featuring 5 preset challenges, some of which have time limits of 5 or 10 minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Shock Trooper is a refined arcade adventure where you, as a fifth column shocktrooper, must infiltrate an alien base and free your captive mates. The complex has a very strong radiation field, which means you must keep on moving unless you want to die just from ambient radiation.You carry a beam weapon, whose beam can extend across the entire screen. The longer you fire it, though, you expose yourself to more radiation. Use the weapon to destroy turrets and power generators which sustain force fields which block your way. Different hostile creatures will also patrol the complex and try to kill you. At certain locations, you are unable to use your gun. Beside that, the main component of the game is to use the platforms and lifts to get to the right place where you can shut off a generator so that you can reach the next generator whose forcefield shuts your path to your mates off.At the end of each level, the radiation you have absorbed is removed, and you receive one of the aliens' secret TRG-5 attack saucer sub-assemblies which must be brought back to your allies.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In the early eighties, when the computer games industry was young, things such as copyrights were taken with a grain of salt. Software developers who saw a game they liked went home to their bedroom and programmed a copy of their own, and then changed a letter in the original title so as to not be sued (c.f. Donkey King).One of the most cloned games must be Konami's Scramble, and a staggering number of those clones were called Skramble with a K. This version of Skramble is Microdeal's rendition for the Dragon 32 and Tandy Colour.Apart from the obvious hardware limitations, this is a rather faithful copy of the original shooter. you fly your spaceship through a cave system (split up on five sections) filled with missiles that launch from the ground, radar installations and disturbing objects that fly in your path. Destroy them with your bombs and forward-mounted gun. All the while, you must keep track of your fuel level. Bomb fuel silos on the ground to fill up.</synopsis>

Watch out for torpedoes and Sonars.This was the first submarine simulation to include aircraft as opponents. You can choose to remain on the surface and defend yourself with your guns, or dive and hope to avoid the bomb and/or strafing that'll surely follow.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.Having nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced variation on the good old Gauntlet concept. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.Each of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).Interestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction. Gaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Gauntlet (obviously), Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Trapfall, or as it is known on the Dragon 32, Cuthbert in the Jungle, is a direct clone of Activision's classic Pitfall. In a red, blue, yellow and green jungle, your hero (Cuthbert) must run through the landscape, avoiding falling into lakes (some of which appear out of nothing, only to disappear again), being crushed by rolling logs, being bit by snakes, scorpions or other dangerous creatures of the jungle. In the lakes live crocodiles, which can be used as stepping stones as long as their jaws are closed. In order to cross lakes, lianas may also be used, Tarzan-style. For some reason, there is a big cellar beneath the jungle into which Cuthbert may fall. It may be used as a way to avoid the dangers on the surface, but it is also inhabited by nasties, and you may run into a cul-de-sac. To spice things up, you only have 20 minutes to reach the end.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Z-89 is the Coco 3 only version of Zaxxon, by the same author (Steve Bjork) who did the original, officially licensed version from Datasoft. This game was released twice (with some slight changes), once when sold by Game Point Software, and then directly by SRB Software after Game Point folded a short time after.
   The basic play of Z-89 is that you have to destroy the Zaxxon robot at the end of the two floating space fortresses, while defending yourself from planes, tanks, missiles, and colliding with terrain. You have to keep your fuel topped up as well, by shooting fuel tanks. The game is played in isometric 3D, showing you flying at an angle, where you can fly side to side and up and down (you are always moving forward). Z-89 adds one new twist to Zaxxon: in the space sequence (between the two floating space fortresses), in addition to planes coming after you, you also have meteors to contend with.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</synopsis>
