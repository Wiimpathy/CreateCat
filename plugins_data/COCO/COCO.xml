      <synopsis>This is a racquetball-like game that is best described as a 3D variation of Breakout.

You are at the end on a rectangular room. On the other end is a wall made of bricks or blocks. The ball travels down to the wall and knocks out a brick. It then returns to your end where you must use a squarish paddle to send the ball back to the wall. If the ball gets past the paddle, you lose a ball.

In the computer version, you must knock out all the bricks of the wall to advance. Each level has more bricks per wall. You begin with 5 balls. In the console version, you must knock out 57 of the 72 bricks to advance. Each level has 72 bricks but the number of balls will lower in later levels. Level 1 starts with 99 balls.</synopsis>

      <genre>Sports,</genre>
      <synopsis>Originally released as part of Zeebo Family Pack, 8ball is a classic snooker game. Players can control the direction of stroke (by clicking on arrows on screen), the strength (by holding down the stroke button on screen), as well as where the white ball will be hit (by placing a blue dot, the aim, in the desired position in a white ball represented on the lower left corner of the screen), to add a spin.

The fist ball sank decides which player goes with the odds and which goes with the evens. Sinking balls in sequence awards more points than just sinking them randomly. Sinking the white ball or hitting an oponnent's ball directly grants the other player the right to place the white wherever he/she wants. As the player wins matches, he/she advances to higher levels with increasingly difficult opponents.

Players can select an avatar when creating a profile. The game includes a global, cross platform high-score ranking that allows the player to share his/her top scores and compete for the highest score possible against other players.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A Mazing World of Malcom Mortar is an original arcade game where you play a character who is trying to get through a maze of walls. You have bricks that you lay, trying to block monsters off (some chase and kill you, some shoot at you, and some destroy the walls you put up). You can also make the walls permanent, but you instantly die if you block the path to your exit. Once you complete enough walls to make yourself a clear path to the exit, a yellow path appears, showing how to exit the maze. You have to pick up bricks as you go, and dynamite (to blow up temporary walls).</synopsis>

      <title>Android Attack</title>
      <genre>Shooter</genre>
      <synopsis>Android Attack is a 32 K update of the Berzerk clone Robot Battle for 16K Tandy Colour systems. The extra memory is used to add in another feature of the original arcade game, namely speech, which is portrayed in its Microdeal title, Talking Android Attack.As in Berzerk, you are a lone humanoid in a large complex with lots of maze-like rooms. Your objective is to survive, and earn points by exterminating all the hostile robots that inhabit the complex. Shooting a robot (before it shoots you) turns it into a heap of deadly scrap, which will reanimate after a short while, though not into the android it once was, but into a ghost. The ghosts can pass through walls and try to fulfill the mission of their former life. This is a slight deviation from the original Berzerk, where the ghost was a separate character called "Evil Otto". Another difference is that in this version, you can jump and duck to avoid robot bullets.Another peril in the game is the walls, which are electrified. By sacrificing an energy unit, of which you need at least three, you can opening up a hole in the wall to pass through. On each screen there is also a crown, which can be picked up for 100 points. Killing an android gives 50 points, and killing its ghost gives you another 100. By eliminating all enemies and picking up the crown and exiting the room, you are granted a bonus sum calculated from the remaining time (when it reaches zero, you are killed). For every 10 000 points, you earn another energy unit. If you leave the room without having killed the enemies, the computer will say in wobbly 6-bit speech, "Coward!".</synopsis>

The player controls a robot that enters the system in an attempt to kill off all the bugs. Each level is a maze with a number of bugs that all have to be killed. The game is played with joystick that allow the player to wander through the corridors of the maze. When encountering enemies the player shoots by holding down the fire button and uses the stick to move the cursor around. Getting hit leads to the robot's energy being absorbed but it can recharged by locating and shooting power units. If the energy decreases to zero the game ends. Once a level has been completed an elevator exit will open and the player can move on to the next level.</synopsis>

      <genre>Strategy</genre>
      <synopsis>In Arex, you play as a spaceship commander invading enemy territory. You goal is to cover as much ground of a grid as possible, while dispensing arrows behind you, and avoiding alien vessels. The player's ship can move in 4 cardinal directions. The player is unable to cross ground they have already covered, but the trail can be destroyed by alien creatures under specific circumstances.

Enemies encountered, include: Snarfs, Snuffers, Diagons, and Rippers. Snuffers move at right angles up or down, and can only be destroyed if trapped in a single space. Diagons are bird-like creatures which will move inexorably at a 45 degree angle, and can be destroyed by trapping between two parallel trails. Snarfs are defenseless creatures which will mutate into Snuffers or Diagons after an unpredictable time period has passed. The Ripper will follow your Arex's trail while stationary, and will only relent if the player keeps moving. Trying to cross the Ripper's trail will lead to the ship's destruction.

There are two play styles, dungeon and arena. Arena features a wide open field, where the goal is to maximize score by surviving as long as possible. Dungeon features a single screen with permanent walls which must be maneuvered around, while attempting to explore the entire environment. If the player explores 90% of the level, they will advance to the next stage. The player starts with 3 vessels, and if all are lost, then it's game over.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lazers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.</synopsis>

      <genre>Action,Arcade,Shooter,</genre>
      <synopsis>AstroBlast is a plain space shoot'em'up, a clone of the arcade game Astro Fighter, which evolved only slightly from the original Space Invaders. Just like in that game, your spaceship must shoot down slowly advancing rows of aliens, and with only one shot on screen at a time. The movement patterns are not yet evolved into something like Galaxian, since the enemies will never swoop down at you, instead moving in formation, but still slightly more advanced than Space Invaders, since they make small lopping patterns to make targeting more difficult. Of course, the barriers of Space Invaders are done away with, since this takes place in space.

Your spaceship has only one life, but three bars on its shield, which yields much the same result as three lives. What sets AstroBlast apart is the small amount of fuel that your ship has, and which can only be refilled every fourth level. You must therefore shoot down all aliens as quickly as possible, or you will run out of fuel before you reach the refueling level.</synopsis>

You have to pick up electrons, and them shoot them to hit the "energy level ring" dots (the innermost circle of dots, near the atomic nucleus).

      <synopsis>You are a robber, whose goal is to collect bags of money in each of the three scenes and dump them in your wheelbarrow, while avoiding miners and moving railcars. You can deal with the miners by using a pickaxe to knock them unconscious for a few seconds. If you are trying collect a money bag but a railcar gets in your way, you can cling onto the ceiling while it passes by. If you drop off the handholds on the ceiling at the right time, you can also ride the railcar to avoid the miners.Once you do collect all the bags of money in one scene, you simply move your wheelbarrow to the next scene. In fact, you can go between the 3 scenes at will; you do not have to collect all the money bags in one scene in order to proceed to the next. In the last two scenes, you have to use elevators to get from Point A to Point B. Be warned: you can only carry one money bag at a time, and the weight of the bag makes you move slowly, making it a lot easier for miners to catch you. Also remember that time is against you, but if you manage to dump a bag in the wheelbarrow, you are given more time.
    There is a special money bag (worth more points) inside a blocked off room, in the middle screen. You need the pickaxe to break through the wall to get it, but it is very heavy, and slows you down much more than a regular money bag.</synopsis>

Whack the food with your club and drag the food back to your cave before a dinosaur eats it – or you. But food alone is not enough for survival, you must also hunt cave-wives to secure your offspring. The procedure is the same here: hit the women with your club before they're eaten by a dinosaur, and drag them by their hair back to the cave. Your score is calculated according to how many seasons you've survived, how many wives and how much offspring you have.</synopsis>

Once all items are picked up a ladder to the next level is introduced. The screen is guarded by nasties such as mice, worms or spiders, which vary according to the level. They can be stopped in their path by digging a hole in the ground for them to fall into.The game features 60 screens, runs in monochrome high resolution and has a (password-protected) level editor.</synopsis>

In this basic text adventure you use commands like GO WEST or GET THE KEY. You can shorten direction commands to WEST or NORTH (or even W or N if you prefer).</synopsis>

While jumping around, you must watch our for the baddies on the screen. The "black" and "red" (their colour changes depending on platform and colour settings) blobs will just jump downwards until they leave the playfield and rematerialise at the top again, while the evil spring can jump in any directions and will hunt poor Blochead all over the place.

      <synopsis>After a successful Pitfall clone, Tom Mix published a Joust clone for the CoCo and Dragon. Just as in the original Joust, you are a knight, riding an ostrich in a dungeon tournament(!). The goal is to force the ostrich to fly onto the platform and to land on your opponents. The opponent ostriches turn into eggs when landed upon, for you to collect. When all opponents are eliminated, you go on to the next level. If you wait too long, a dangerous pterodactyl will enter the screen to chase you down. Buzzard Bait is mostly feature-complete compared to its role model, including lava trolls. To cope with the limited colour repertoire of the Motorola 6847 chip, you can choose between three colour schemes for the game, ranging from the system green and "buff" to a pure black and white mode.</synopsis>

      <genre>Adventure,</genre>
      <synopsis>Caladuril: Flame of Light is an adventure game that is both graphic and text based. The player is Jamarend Tarinson, a young man whose valley has been invaded by evil beasts. Now he has to go out and find the magical Caladuril sword and defeat Silmnoleh, the evil villain.

The game uses a split screen where the lower part shows text and the upper part shows the player's position in the world from a top down perspective as well as lists of visible objects and inventory. Moving through the world is done by direct control of the character in the upper window while all interaction with objects and NPCs is done through a text parser. Like in any text adventure game the parser accepts verb noun commands like "enter door" and "get key" but it can only be done when the objects appear under the list of visible objects or in the inventory.

The Palm OS version replaces the text parser with four buttons: get/drop, examine, use/go and combine.</synopsis>

You can play against a computer opponent, or another person (there is a 3rd mode, which is computer vs. computer, which is basically a demo mode). Unlike the original version (or other Coco versions such as Tom Mix's War Kings), you do not have to break down a barrier, but you gradually cause the castle to sink completely into the ground.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Castle of Tharoggad is a Coco 3 only game that was meant to be a sequel to the best selling Dungeons of Daggorath, althought you had to work your way up a castle, instead of down a dungeon. The game didn't do as well, and was chastised by many, due to the changes done from the original hit. The graphics, even though they used the Coco 3's superior 16 color mode, looked too cartoony, even compared to the originals black &amp;amp; white wireframes, and the sound wasn't as good. The biggest bone of contention was that it was completely mouse/joystick driven, while the original was keyboard. The game lost a lot because of this... the gameplay just wasn't the same. Nowadays, as everyone is used to using mice, it may have been received better.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The objective of Catchem is to catch all falling objects. Each level features a different object falling. When any object is missed, you lose a live, and your paddle, which you use to catch the objects, shrinks with one paddle. When a 'bad object' like a lightning is catched, you also lose a live. You can re-win this live, but you can't have more lives than your 3 starting lives. Subsequent levels get more and more difficult simply because of the speed. Each four levels, a bonus level appears where you may or may not avoid all objects: it's simply for points.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Starship Chameleon is an arcade style game, loosely based on the Atari 2600 hit Kaboom!. The basic premise is to try and catch all of the bombs before they hit the bottom. It differs from Kaboom! by being more diverse and complicated: The aliens at the top can drop 'semi-intelligent aerial smart bombs', which you can NOT catch, and follow you around horizontally. You also have to be the same color as the bomb you are trying to catch (yellow or blue), which you can change by hitting the joystick button. Also, solid bombs are worth 100 points, but hollow bombs are worth 1000. There are multiple skill levels, and level 9 is basically impossible (the aliens will shower dozens of bombs at once, leaving you little choice but to miss most of them).</synopsis>

      <genre>Board game</genre>
      <synopsis>Checker King is a computer adaptation of the board game Checkers. The game is for one player who competes against an AI opponent. It is played by using the keyboard to type in commands. To move a piece the player simply enters the number of the square it is on followed by the number of the square it should be moved to. Multiple moves can be made in a single text line, for example 25-18-9.

The game follows official rules and when a capturing move is available the player is forced to make it. At any time it is possible to exchange positions with the AI opponent and it is also possible to have the AI take control of both sets of pieces and play against itself. Another option of the game is to modify the board. It allows the player to set up new situations by removing or adding pieces. The game comes with three checker puzzles where situations are predefined. The AI level of the opponent can be set from 1 to 8.</synopsis>

The player is in control of a helicopter flying over a mountainous terrain where hostile gun turrets, rockets, oil tanks and ICBM's are placed. On the ground there are also blue men that the player can pick up by flying over them. The helicopter's only weapons are missiles whose direction the player can steer by pulling the joystick up and down. The game is made up of one large level where the player simply has to try and stay alive as long as possible. A life is lost when hit by an enemy projectile but also when accidentally killing one of the blue men.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Clowns &amp;amp; Balloons is a clone of the old arcade game Circus (1977), except with better graphics and sound. It is an arcade style game by Steve Bjork, where you control the two people holding the trampoline at the bottom of the screen, and you must keep the clown bouncing around to pop all of the balloons scrolling (in different directions) at the top of the screen. When the clown first starts bouncing, he doesn't go very high; the longer you keep him going, the higher he will bounce. You can bounce the clown off the walls too; but not off the floor (you lose a life at that point). One cute thing about the game is that plays little blips of circus style music each time you complete popping a row of balloon; this also gives you a small breather.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Color Baseball is an adaptation of the sport for one or two players who compete in single matches between unnamed red and blue teams. It is possible to assign a name and a batting average for each athlete in both teams.

When the team is up to bat the player controls the batter's swing and can make a base runner steal or slide into a base by using the joystick. It is possible to switch from a right handed batter to a left handed. Swinging is done by pressing the button and the power is decided by up-down position of the joystick. When running the player is always in control of the lead base runner.

When on the field, the player controls both the pitcher and all the other players. Different pitches can be done by pulling the joystick in different directions. For example a downward pull leads to a fast pitch while a diagonal downward pull leads to a curved ball. When the ball is in the air control is automatically given to the fielder that is closest to it. Once the ball has been caught the joystick is used to choose which player to throw it to.</synopsis>

Like in the original game the cube is made up of 27 smaller cubes (called cubies) of six different colours and the aim is to rotate the slices so that each face is made up of a solid color. The cube is isometrically drawn and the player uses keyboard controls to roll the slices. While working on the cube it is possible to undo and redo up to 255 moves. A reset cube option allows the player to see how a particular cube is constructed and it's also possible to create custom cube configurations. There is also an option to use tapes to save and load games.</synopsis>

      <title>Color Meteoroids</title>
      <genre>Shooter</genre>
      <synopsis>Meteoroids is another Asteroids clone. You fly your spaceship around a screen filled with asteroids, and shoot them into smaller and smaller pieces until they are destroyed. If you get in trouble, you can hit the emergency teleport button and end up somewhere else on the screen.What makes Meteoroids deviate from the norm is its control system. Instead of the usual Asteroids system, where you turn your ship around its axis and accelerate by pressing forward, this game uses two analogue joysticks. The first joystick simply pushes the ship in whichever direction you push the joystick. Since the control is analogue, you have a fair amount of fine control over both thrust and direction. The second joystick controls the direction of your cannon in a similar fashion. This poses a new challenge to Asteroids fans.</synopsis>

Its behaviour is almost exactly that of the original, with rows of aliens moving slowly in a zig-zag pattern across the screen, downwards to the player which can only move left and right. The player has three barriers to hide behind, but these are gradually worn down by alien shots. An additional small barrier can be moved around to cover the player as well. From time to time, a UFO worth extra points will cross the top of the screen. Fifteen difficulty levels are available.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Crystle Castles, or Ice Castles as it is also known, is a straight copy of Atari's Crystal Castles. Your hero must pick upp all the dots (crystals) spread around the isometric castle-like mazes guarded by deadly creatures. The concept is a bit like a three-dimensional Pac-man. Some paths and platforms require you to take a lift to reach them, and some levels also have tunnels between different parts of the screen. The tunnels are a source of confusion, since you can still see your character as in plain daylight while traversing the tunnel. Most levels are picked straight from the Atari original, though notably lacking the opening maze where the landscape spelt out the name of the company whose intellectual property was being infringed upon.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In this installment of the Cuthbert Saga, Cuthbert goes for a stroll on a grid. As he walks along all four sides of a cell in a grid, it changes color, and when all cells have been coloured, it is on to the next grid. This would have been too easy, were it not for the nasties that also walk along the grid. Cuthbert's only weapons are his wits and his ability to jump over the nasties. Just try not to jump out of the screen! The inspiration for this game is the old arcade game, Amidar, and it can be seen as a primitive version of Oh Mummy.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In this episode in Cuthbert's adventurous life, he finds himself in something that could be described as hell, even though the title tells us that it is a mine. One could say that it is a cross between both. A queue of Cuthberts wait to be rescued from the mine, which means climbing up through several levels of rails with ore wagons before reaching the surface. This can be described as similar to the road in Frogger in gameplay, but is complicated by the ladder on which Satan himself climbs back and forth, firing a bolt of fire at Cuthbert whenever he finds himself at the same layer. Being hit by the fire means that Cuthbert is sent falling to a certain death in the flaming pits of hell which is found beneath the rails. Being hit by a rail car, on the other hand, simply means that he is sent back to a lower rail. If he is hit by another wagon there, the procedure is repeated, until he eventually winds up in the flames anyway. The line of Cuthberts is seemingly infinite, but after five are killed, it's game over. As they reach the surface, the skill level is raised, which means that the cars go at a faster pace and with smaller gaps between them.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>When a game is faithful to the poor writing and wildly implausible plot conventions of a soap opera, does that make it a bad game or an effective adaptation of its source material? In any case, this game situates you as a private investigator hired by Sue Ellen to find a map to hidden oil fields, in hopes to accumulate enough wealth to escape the sinister influence of J.R. Sue Ellen offers you a reward of $2 million for the map. You snoop around the grounds of the South Fork Ranch, superficially interacting with much-loved characters from the TV show and an assortment of extras from the animal kingdom. You must avoid J.R. who would like to put a stop to Sue Ellen's plans. So far, so good.

Your travels ultimately lead you to the jungles around Playa Peligro, in South America, where you overcome a series of obstacles by using various techniques, but mostly by doping a friendly monkey with tobacco -- a firm reminder that we're descending beneath even soap opera plot conflicts and sitting squarely in an early-'80s text adventure game, with all of the internal logic-twisting that entails.</synopsis>

This game is one of the earlier games that Spectral Associates ended up licensing to Radio Shack. In the early 1980's, Spectral published all their stuff on their own; by the mid-1980's, they licensed most of their stuff to Radio Shack. The official Tandy/Radio Shack demo for the Coco 3 was written by them.</synopsis>

You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Devil Assault is, as the name implies, based on Imagic's popular Demon Attack, a frantic fixed-screen shooter.The game is played in waves:
The first wave is the bombing wave. Three monstrous space birds fly around and shoot at you. Whenever you shoot one, it regenerates, until their ranks are sufficiently diminished.
After that comes another bombing wave.
The robot wave is similar, but with robots with more intricate movement patterns. You must not let your trigger finger rest here, because the robots will try to walk down beside you where you cannot hit them with your bullets.
The sproings level feature enemies who jump up and down on the screen. Let them not jump into you.
Like many other primitive shoot'em'ups (though this one is otherwise much less primitive than many others), you have only one bullet on screen at any time, and it follows your ship to the left and right. This turns out to be a major part of the gameplay, since it alters the way you calculate the right moment to fire and even lets you criss-cross your bullet between enemies in order to hit those higher up.</synopsis>

      <genre>Action,Arcade,Fighting,</genre>
      <synopsis>Dino Wars is an arcade-style fast-action game, where the two players (there is no single player mode) control two battling dinosaurs via joystick control. Each player tries to position his Dino in front or behind the other for a quick roaring bite attack for a knock down, reducing the score of the other player's Dino by 20 points.

The playing field scrolls to the left and right, but also contains some depth of field, both near and far. This allows for dodging to avoid your opponent’s parallel attack. Once you have successfully reduced your opponent's score to zero, his Dino will run off into the distance yelping due to his wounds.</synopsis>

      <genre>Action,Arcade,</genre>
      <synopsis>In the opening sequence of Donpan, you see a girl whose balloon floats away, caught by the wind. That balloon turns out to be none other than the magical creature Donpan. Floating on the wind, Donpan now sets out on a journey toward his home island, where he will be greeted as the king.

Donpan is a side-scrolling avoid'em'up comprising several levels: the town, the sea and the Donpan island. The player sprite bounces constantly, and one can only control how high it should bounce and if it should bounce back or forward.

As a balloon creature, or some kind of magical puffer fish, Donpan can blow himself up and spurt out air from his belly on incoming birds, which would otherwise puncture him. If too much air is let out, Donpan shrinks and can no longer use this ability. In order to blow himself up, he can catch balloons, some of which carry gifts containing a score bonus.</synopsis>

For those that don't know Nintendo's original, it is the first game where Mario appears, and one of the earliest platformers. On each level, high up on a building site, Mario must climb his way up to the big ape and free a damsel in distress. The giant ape throws obstacles which Mario must avoid, in addition to the hostile environment containing fires and conveyor belts. Donkey King has all the stages of the original Donkey Kong, known here as the Barrels, Pins, Jacks and Conveyor screens. It has even retained the cut scenes and the hair style of Mario's beloved.A feature unique to this version is the option to play in three different colour modes: green, buff or black and white.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Doodle Bug is a clone of the arcade game, Lady Bug, itself a close relative of the original Pac-Man. Just like the yellow pill-eater, you guide your sprite around a maze populated by nasties, and can only escape once you've eaten all the pills in the maze. A baddie in the centre of the screen will spawn a new baddie every time the running meter on the score panel has reached zero.The powerup system does not work like Pac-Man, though. No invincibility pills are available, instead, there are a number of letters from the words "special" and "extra" displayed at the top of the screen. When the letters are the same colour as the words they belong to, you begin to spell out those words, granting you either a "special" round or an "extra" life. Additionally, the heart bonuses act as score multipliers for your pills.Without any power pills, your bug is quite vulnerable. Therefore, the environment must be used to its advantage. Many walls in the Doddle Bug maze function like revolving doors which, when passed, will rotate to block the path of a baddie that could otherwise hunt you down.</synopsis>

      <title>Doubleback</title>
      <genre>Action,Arcade,</genre>
      <synopsis>This ROM cartridge game challenges the player to draw circles around objects which pop up on the screen.

Your joystick steers the head of a constantly moving line segment, which by circling it back upon itself, you can make into a loop. Capture an object within that loop, and you score points. Objects continue to appear on the screen, and stay until you circle them. Capture more than one object in the same loop and your reward is multiplied.

The difficulty of the game is in avoiding the objects. Your line segment can run into itself and the edge of the map, but not one of the objects you're trying to circle. That ends your turn. Play becomes a trick of turning tighter and tighter circles to capture objects before they disappear, but not too tightly as to run into them. You can vary your speed, and correspondingly the length of your line segment, by the distance your joystick is from its center. The result is that at maximum speed and length, your line turns widely.

Further increasing the challenge is that the objects move. Apples and cherries are nice and stationary, but the magnets drift slowly. The roller skates skate. Then the yo-yo's appear, doing what yo-yo's do. Timing becomes important. The final complication is the skulls. They're worth no points and they don't go away until you crash. You just have to dodge them and keep circling the moving objects. Hot seat play for two players is possible, giving you the opportunity to laugh at someone else for their inability to draw a circle.</synopsis>

When on defense, you can try to take your rival's ball or jump up to block a shot. Particularly good set-ups get a slow-motion replay. You can even smash the glass on the backboard, which will send an irate janitor onto the court to clean up the mess.</synopsis>

The treasures are being kept in various castles, each one guarded by a fire breathing dragon. Each level in the game has two parts; first you will need to cross the castle's drawbridge. You will have to jump and duck the dragons fireballs as well as avoid flying arrows to reach the other side! In the second part you need to collect all of the treasures on the screen and make it to the exit while avoiding the dragon who runs across the bottom of the screen. The dragons on each level have different patterns of movement and firing, and as the levels progress will become faster and trickier.</synopsis>

      <title>Dungeons Of Daggorath</title>
      <genre>RPG</genre>
      <synopsis>Dungeons of Daggorath is a dungeon crawler which has rudimentary magic, character building, and combat elements, like a Wizardry-style RPG, while also using a text parser like a graphic adventure. The top part of the screen is dominated by a first-person view of the dungeon, while the player enters his/her commands at the bottom. Verb recognition includes commands such as MOVE, TURN, USE, ATTACK, STOW, and INCANT.

The game contains five levels of dungeon to explore, and more and more powerful monsters the deeper the player character advances. Some monsters of the same type get stronger as well - for example, the troll starts on level one armed with a club, but on later levels he gets more powerful with an axe. Other features include different levels of torches that affect viewing distance and eventually wear out; monsters generating different sounds that grow louder or fainter as they get closer to the protagonist (even if they cannot be seen behind walls); and the real-time aspect of the heartbeat. If the player character is injured or running too fast, his heart rate increases, and he may pass out if the player pushes too far. During that time, monsters would keep moving and attacking.</synopsis>

Mario must run across all rivets in a scaffolding in order to loosen the structure so that it eventually falls down, taking the "Munkey" with itself. The structure is filled with wandering flames which must be avoided. A bonus item in the shape of a fire extinguisher can be used to put out the flames, but it only works for a short while and disables jumps and ladder climbing.The second screen is a combination of two original screens, namely the "barrels" and "lifts" screens, where Dunkey throws barrels down the platforms and Mario must take the lift to reach the kidnapped girl. This screen is reached only after clearing the first screen twice.The Dragon version runs in four-colour mode, whereas the CoCo version uses the NTSC artifact mode for a colour set that better matches that of the original.</synopsis>

The player scrolls over a 3-dimensional wireframe city, looking for active fires. The player needs to position the copter over the center of the fire to spray water cannons to put out the fire. In addition, fire starting androids are present throughout the city, which need to be shot with the copter's laser cannons. The player receives points for fires put out and androids destroyed. As fire spreads, the city is in critical danger, and the player loses a life when too much of the city is engulfed in flame. The player has a total of 3 lives, and when all are lost it's game over. The fire has been quelled at the start of each life, and the city begins to burn anew.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>If there were any doubt as to the quality of Flight Simulator II, it should be dispelled by the knowledge that SubLOGIC went to the FAA for approval of its use in flight training.  Whether or not they actually got the approval—remember this was 1984, and such application of personal computers was new ground—they attempted to create a realistic flight simulator.This flight simulator simulates a real aircraft, the Piper PA-23-181 Archer II.  For those with the knowledge, it offers practice with the variables of flight, including the avionics. The Atari ST-release (1986), instead, simulates the Cessna 182 single engine propeller aircraft and the Gates Learjet 25G twin engine jet. The simulator was considered to be a second generation product.  It had many more features than first generation flight simulators, and pilots were expected to pay attention to small details.  SubLOGIC encouraged the users of the game to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program.  The game was oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there were options for non pilots too: the company included an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode.  These modes did not require the same level of knowledge.Flight Simulator II was also packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace.  In this game your plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen.  The radar screen is anachronistic for a game set in World War I, but it is there to help gameplay.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The conception of the Flight Simulator computer game series, still going strong today, began in the late 1970's with "FS1", created by Bruce Artwick of subLOGIC and released in early 1980. First came the Apple ][, with a very scaled down instrument panel on bottom and outside/radar view on top, then the TRS-80, with mere 128x48 monochrome graphics and thus numbers and bars replacing the panel.

There was only one aircraft and one region: a 6x6 grid with "mountains". The user could press "W" and "declare war", entering the WW1 "British Ace" game mode. The objective was to shoot down enemy planes and bomb their base.

Both the Apple ][ and TRS-80 versions originally came on cassette tape. The Apple ][ version was updated in 1981 with minor improvements.

Note that the first PC version, Microsoft Flight Simulator (v1.0), was released two years later and is more similar to the 8-bit versions of Flight Simulator II.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In Fraction Fever, the player's goal is to advance floors up to the twentieth with the help of his pogo stick and the Fraction Elevators located on each floor. To find them, the player needs to look for the correct fraction pictures, matching what is shown at the top of the screen, while a radar shows the layout of floors at the bottom. Incorrect fractions can be knocked down for scoring points, but this leaves holes in the floors. When the player doesn't manage to jump over these and falls down far enough or several times, the game will end. There is also a time limit to look out for, if the clock reaches zero the Fraction Elevator of the current floor cannot be reached, and the player has to jump down a floor to be able to try again.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Fury is a variant of the arcade game Time Pilot. The player is the sole defender of a small South American country that is being overtaken by communists and has to shoot down as many enemies as possible before the CIA steps in. Like in the arcade game the player is in control of a plane that can move and shoot in multiple directions. Among the enemy forces there are airplanes, helicopters and hot balloons that can be shot down and parachutes that have to be rammed. As the game goes on it gets harder with the addition of magnetic air mines. These will chase the player who has to dodge them. The first one appears after scoring 5,000 points but the amount increases at higher point values. After scoring 30,000 points the player's air cannons heat up making it necessary to fire slower.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Galax Attax is a clone of Namco's Galaxian, which was one of the first shoot'em'ups to deviate from the original Space Invaders fare in favor of things such as aliens with individual behavior and movement.Your goal: Shoot down all the aliens as they fly in formation. If they break free from their formation and fly at you, they are worth twice as many points, while also being more dangerous.On the Tandy computer, the game uses NTSC artifacting for colour on a black space backdrop, whereas the Dragon version has been reprogrammed with a white backdrop, which makes the orange bullets harder to see, resulting in an overall more difficult game. The Tandy version was later reprogrammed with new sprites which looked more like the insect-themed ones from the original Galaxian instead of the more abstract ones of the first version.</synopsis>

      <genre>Action,Arcade,Platform,</genre>
      <synopsis>Ghana Bwana is an arcade action game with isometric graphics similar to the arcade game Congo Bongo. The game is set on a fictitious African island and is made up of nine levels, some scrolling and some fixed, with the objective of the seven first being to collect all the pieces of a treasure map. The levels are timed and all pieces have to be collected before the time runs out.

In the first level the player is seated in a canoe going down a river while later levels are on foot. The levels on foot allow the player to jump which is necessary in the non-scrolling levels for leaping between islands without landing in water. There are some perils to watch out for like moving objects and natives called guardians that throw spears. Some items can be picked up including a bow for shooting the guardians and a golden key which can be used to open a treasure chest which gives an extra life. In the eight level the aim is to get to a balloon and escape while in the final level the balloon is shot down and the player returns to the first scene and begins a new round of the game.</synopsis>

If you press the fire button repeatedly, the last shot fired disappears. On the other hand, the enemies' shots are target seeking. Also, your ship isn't destroyed on contact with enemies or bullets.

As in Lode Runner, you mission is to steal all of the gold bars, while avoiding the guards, and escape up to the next level after you have gotten them all. Guards can pick up to 1 Gold bar themselves, and the only way to get them back is to dig a self filling hole in the ground (on ground that you can actually dig in) early enough that it kills the guard. If you dig it to late, the guard will crawl out on his own (something you can not do if you get in the same situation). The game takes on strategy and maze play as well, as some of the gold bars are buried inside walls that you have to dig through to get to them.</synopsis>

Your only goal is to crush the insects by pushing ice blocks at them. You can only push one block at a time. Trying to push a block that is blocked by another block will instead destroy the block so that you can push the one behind it. All insects must be crushed before you can go on to the next level, which is made more difficult by the fact that they respawn, so killing all in a quick succession is required. Bonus score is calculated based on how much time is used. The game runs in black and white high resolution mode, with artifact colour on NTSC machines.</synopsis>

You, of course, are the computer expert, and your skills will be put to the test, typing in included BASIC programs to decrypt secret messages, weigh tolerances, plot courses through labyrinths and calculate necessary angles of deflection.  The abilities of the whole team will be called for to overcome natural obstacles, untrusting natives, the sapping effects of the Devorim Force, BRUTE agents, a traitor in your midst, the perils and traps of the golden lost city containing the artifact, and the deadly artifact itself!Though the story shares the dynamic 2nd-person perspective ("You try to talk, but you cannot make a sound") of Choose-Your-Own-Adventures, the text (like most books) is a non-interactive fixed-rail trip of zero interactivity -- however, some of the type-in programs included offer numerous outcomes, moving into the "game" field what might otherwise be best categorized as an elaborate set-up for low-impact programming exercises.An appendix is included describing how to modify the BASIC program listings for greatest compatibility with 10 of the most popular home microcomputer BASICs, as well as describing what each program does and how it works.

This he must do by climbing up and down vines and jumping between platforms, avoiding the fish-like creatures that run up and down the vines. On later screens, he must climb chains to push locks into position so that the cage holding his father is opened. Fruits can be found hanging on the vines and chains, which can be picked up for points, upon which they drop, eliminating any enemies unfortunate enough to be positioned underneath.The game runs in artifact mode on Tandy computers, and with the usual three colour selections on a Dragon.</synopsis>

The first of the three games (each with four skill levels, demanding faster reflexes) presents the player with falling letters which must be typed correctly before hitting the bottom of the screen... and eventually the game's mascot floats down defying the player to type in an entire word. The second game takes word-typing as a given skill, as the player is now in charge of typing in the full names of icons of common household objects gradually floating down the screen. In the third game, an object is named on the bottom of the screen and the player must punch in the correct number corresponding to the object's icon, displayed on screen.

The second and third games have bonus rounds whose gameplay is as the regular rounds, except that the icons are now partially obscured, demanding a certain exercise of player memory faculties.</synopsis>

      <title>Klendathu</title>
      <synopsis>Based on Robert A. Heinlein's Hugo-award winning book, Starship Troopers, this game simulates the brief combat life in M.I. (Mobile Infantry) far in the future. The Terran Federation is locked in a deadly war with "the Bugs," and has announced "Operation Bughouse," an attack directly on the Bugs' home world of Klendathu. Equipped with a state-of-the-art power suit, you drop in from orbit and and torch as many Bug warriors as possible, then bounce back out before your suit runs out of energy or the Bugs overwhelm you. Survive three drops and you can retire, with pay based on how many Bugs of each rank you blasted.

Game play consists of carefully selecting which block of the drop zone to land in, and then blasting the warrior and queen Bugs as they advance down the screen toward you. For each warrior and queen you might see, however, there are many more harmless worker Bugs, which look exactly like the warriors. They're all swarming toward you; choose your targets carefully and don't waste your ammo. You'll know the warriors because they're the ones shooting at you.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Labyrinth is a first person maze game where the player has to hunt down and kill nine monsters. The game plays like other early first person games with the player moving ahead one step at a time. Once a monster appears on the screen the player has to try and shoot it by moving a gun sight left and right. To kill a monster it has to be hit right between the eyes. If taking too long or if running into the monster the player will be killed. There are no lives to lose but an extra monster will appear in the maze. When moving around an arrow shows the direction to the nearest monster and a number shows the distance.</synopsis>

      <title>Leisure Suit Larry In The Land Of The Lounge Lizards</title>
      <genre>Adventure,Adult,</genre>
      <synopsis>Larry Laffer is a short, tacky, balding, forty-year-old man who has been living with his mother until recently. He used to be in the software business, but decided to leave everything behind as he moved to the city of Lost Wages in pursuit of sexual fulfillment. Clad in a white polyester leisure suit, Larry finds himself outside of Lefty's Bar, determined to finally lose his virginity - or commit suicide if he is unable to achieve that goal before dawn.

Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure, though with a greatly enhanced script containing more humorous descriptions and dialogue. The gameplay is similar to other third-person Sierra adventures: a text parser is used to input commands for interaction with a graphical environment. Progress is achieved by collecting various items and figuring out which of those may be essential for conquering the hearts of the several female characters appearing in the game.

The game allows the player to access most of its locations (a bar, a casino, a convenience store, etc.) from the very beginning, with only a few key ones being barred due to the lack of a crucial item. Moving between some of the locations can only be done by cab. Paying for those trips, as well as procuring some of the items, requires the player to manage Larry's finance by gambling at the casino. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions. There are several ways to die in the game, most presented in a humorous fashion. The game contains adult situations and semi-implicit depictions of sex.</synopsis>

It is a near-perfect replica (given the limitations of the hardware) of the moon-driving, jumping, shooting arcade game. Like the original, it has both beginner and expert courses where you drive your four-wheel (this is one small difference) moon-car on the rocky surface of the moon. While your suspension takes care of most of the terrain, there are some rough spots. You must jump across the craters and above the moon-rocks. And as if that wasn't enough, there are attacking aliens. You must shoot these down with your guns, one pointing in your driving direction and one overhead.</synopsis>

      <title>Madness And The Minotaur</title>
      <genre>Adventure,</genre>
      <synopsis>A bold adventurer descends into the enormous labyrinth of the Cretan King Minos at Knossos, hoping to part seven mythical monsters (including the terrifying, titular, Minotaur) from sixteen treasures and escape with his life, helped only by a handful of arcane spells acquired while navigating dead ends and the enigmatic ramblings of an inspired Oracle wandering the maze.

It's not entirely fair to blame the period hardware limitations for this game's poorly-aged VERB NOUN text parser, as Infocom first launched home versions of Zork I a year earlier, but at the time its grammar was still industry-standard par for the course. What made this title stand out is also what kept its adherents on their toes (... for decades) -- inconstant internal rules and conditions that changed every time the game was played.

Much like the colour of potions in Nethack shuffling their associations with spell effects between games, this game not only jumbles the relation between spell names and their effects, but also the conditions that must be met in order to learn them! Similarly unpredictable are the locations and vulnerabilities of monsters and treasures. Add to that a huge (four floors of 64 rooms each) maze full of one-way passages, bogus "dummy" treasures, realtime monster movement, unreliable and abstruse room connections and you end up with a devious dungeon indeed.</synopsis>

A long time ago, a thief stole the planets memory crystal and broke it up into nine pieces, hiding them on each planet in the solar system. It is Mickey's job to travel to each planet and locate the crystals so the inhabitants of the planet Oron may receive their memory back. Information about the different planets and locations visited are displayed on arrival, and XL30 may occasionally give clues through the ships computer. The interface for the game doesn't use a text parser, instead short sentences are created by using the cursor keys to highlight the necessary words from a selection on the screen. The game will also suggest better options if an illogical or impossible action is requested.</synopsis>

Marginally upgraded (the TRS-80 version expanded to 4k: 2k for game logic and 2k for a picture of a chess board) for the burgeoning microcomputer market (why restrict input and output to a hex keyboard and 6 LED digit displays if you don't have to?) it went on to sell over a million copies for the Apple 2 and TRS-80 (and, among the usual suspects, also eventually ported to other hobby platforms such as those made by "Processor Technology, Imsai, Cromemco, Polymorphic Systems, MITS, Ohio Scientific, and many more") before quickly being overtaken by the likes of Sargon.</synopsis>

The first is the classic first "barrels" screen, where the Mario-like character must climb a scaffolding and jump over the barrels that Monkey Kong rolls toward him. In the level are also two hammers, which Mario/Cuthbert can use to smash the barrels. Wielding the hammer makes him unable to jump and climb ladders, though.The second screen is the "rivets" screen, where you must climb the ladders of another scaffolding that is on fire. Avoid the fires and pop the rivets that hold the platforms together. Once they are all popped, the scaffolding will collapse and take the monkey with itself.Graphically, Monkey Kong is not as blatant a copy as Donkey King, but still makes no effort to mask Mario as anything else but Mario (or Cuthbert). The game runs in four-colour mode.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Essentially a clone of Moon Patrol, Moon Hopper is a speedy scrolling game where you control an armed moon buggy, rolling across a moon surface guarded by lots of aliens. Unlike Moon Patrol, you can't control the angle of the cannon mounted on the roof, instead simply firing upwards at all times, with another gun pointing forward. Apart from the aliens, you also have craters to worry about, which must be jumped across, and junk getting in your way, which can be shot with your other cannon.The scrolling is variable, which means that you can speed up your vehicle to avoid enemy fire. A meter at the bottom shows how far along a level you have come.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Based on the 1981 Nichibutsu Arcade game. 
Aliens have invaded our asteroid belt! It's up to you to get rid of them. 
Your space ship on the bottom of the vertically scrolling screen dodges and shoots at asteroids, hostile ships and the like. 
By moving left and right and firing rapidly, first you must clear a path through the asteroids. Only then you can take on the alien craft. Pushing up on the joystick increases speed, but crashing into an asteroid means death. A bonus is awarded if you pass through unscathed. Once on the other side, the aliens attack from the top and sides of the screen and drop  missiles. The first wave is just a teaser. Progressive waves are more aggressive and harder to kill. If you destroy a certain number of aliens, more asteroids must be avoided or destroyed, followed by yet another alien attack, and so on, until eventually all are defeated or you have no more lives.</synopsis>

      <title>Ninja Warrior</title>
      <genre>Fighting</genre>
      <synopsis>Ninja Warrior is a basic side scrolling jump and shoot game, similar in concept to Moon Patrol. The difference, of course, being that you are a Ninja, and you are crushing rocks, spearing fireballs, deflecting arrows, etc. The game runs it's title and option selection screens in a semi-graphics mode, so you can't see the whole screen on a Coco 3, but the main gameplay is in a "normal" mode which runs fine on all Coco's.The game's levels are based on your belt color (like real martial arts have), and as you progress, you go up through the belt ranks (white, yellow, 2nd level yellow, etc.). Each level also introduces a new "opponent" to worry about, and combinations of "opponents" that you have encountered in the earlier levels. Some examples from the early levels are: White Belt - Rocks, and occasional holes in the ground; Yellow - adds stationary fireballs on the ground; 2nd level Yellow belt - adds fireballs being flung at you from off screen, and many more as you progress up into the black belt ranks.While the graphics are decidedly lo-resolution (128x96x4, to help the game fit into 16K RAM), the game play is actually a lot of fun, especially when you reach higher levels for the first time and you have no idea what new surprise you will encounter next.</synopsis>

When on offense, the player can rotate to keep away from his rival, take a shot from a distance or move in to the basket for special up-close slam-dunks. When on defense, you can try to take your rival's ball or jump up to block a shot. Particularly good set-ups get a slow-motion replay. You can even smash the glass on the backboard, which will send an irate janitor onto the court to clean up the mess.</synopsis>

Pressing fire will fire in the direction you're moving, eliminating all ghosts and dots which get in your way. You have three shots per life.

      <genre>Puzzle</genre>
      <synopsis>An original game, Panic Button involved one working on a multi-level manufacturing line, trying to keep up orders by assembling various products. The parts drop out of 3 chutes on the top left of the playfield, and you can run all over the place to pick up the 3 different parts of the product, and you have to assemble them in order (for example, a robot must have it's feet on the bottom, torso in the middle, and head on the top). The pieces come out of the first conveyor belt in random order, and you can only carry one piece at a time. If you accidentally assemble a product in the wrong order, it becomes useless, so you have to careful where you drop the pieces. There is also a Panic Button (hence the game name) in the upper right corner that you can hit that stops the conveyor belts temporarily.
For each level, you have to make a specific amount of the product you are creating within a time limit of 2 minutes, and each successive level gets faster and faster (and you also have to build more and more). Also, since the 3 conveyor belts are staggered, and pieces will drop on their own between them, you have to be careful watching them as they get near a drop point, as they could fall on pieces you have already constructed and potentially screw that particular product up. On later levels, the bad products start bouncing around as well, interfering with your manoeuvring.</synopsis>

      <title>Pegasus And The Phantom Riders</title>
      <genre>Action,Arcade,</genre>
      <synopsis>Pegasus and the Phantom Riders is a derivative work of the arcade classic Joust. The player rides the white winged horse Pegasus from Greek mythology. Players must approach the Phantom Riders just above, so that Pegasus can use his hooves to destroy them. They will fall from the sky and, if they land on the ground below, a cross grave marker will appear. If players leave the grave marker undisturbed it will turn into a carnivorous plant and revive the rider to fight again.

The game has three phases with multiple waves of Phantom Riders that must be defeated before moving onto the next level, taking the player closer to the phantom island. The game features a quasi-3D effect that all of the Phantom Riders fly in from the distant phantom island. As players proceed through levels, they get closer to the island. The last level has several dangers; Phantom Riders, fireballs, carnivorous plants, or drowning if Pegasus falls into the sea. The game allows for 1 or 2 players with duel and cooperative modes.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>You move about a randomly generated maze, searching for three phantoms to kill. When you begin the game, you can select whether you want a simple maze, with lots of long hallways, or a complex maze, with lots or turns and dead ends. When you find a phantom, you shoot it. Once you kill a phantom, it regenerates in a random location in the maze. Each time you kill a phantom, they will then require more shots to kill. Also, in the maze, is a randomly placed teleport square that will charge you and place you in the center of the maze as well as briefly show you a map of the maze, including the phantoms. The teleport square regenerates after it is used.

This game is considered an early forerunner of the modern first-person shooter genre.

Pitfall II is the sequel to Pitfall!, the original platform game. Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter in the form of red crosses. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint. The score is reduced based on the distance travelled to get to the cross.

As he explores Harry can collect gold bars which give him a 5000 points award. His total score acts as an energy reserve. If the score is reduced to zero then the game ends and the player must restart from the beginning.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</synopsis>

The Predator knows no pain--and shows no mercy.  It has already destroyed all the men of your crack commando unit.  It would like nothing better than to skin you alive and add your skull to is collection.  Blow it away, and it will only come back.  Just for fun. Just for you.

 Soon, you'll wonder which one of you is the hunter and which is the hunted. 

When you're dropped into the jungle, you'll get to battle guerillas hand-to-hand while dodging scorpions, deadly rolling rocks, and the Pedator's pets.  Survive all that and you get to meet the Predator--again and again. 

Can you win?  More to the point, can you survive?  Because in Predator, just staying alive through all the stages of raw combat action is winning.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>An arcade style game with a loose basis on the arcade hit Defender, Protector II is a side-scrolling shooter. Like Defender, there are lots of different aliens to contend with, and some ground based enemies as well. There are no smart bombs, however. You have to rescue humans as well (twice) from both an alien ship, and later a city that will be overrun with lava from a volcano that erupts during the game; all the while protecting them from aliens. You then have to drop them one at a time (unlike Defender, you can only carry one human at a time) into a teleporter tube to get them off the planet entirely.
   The game is quite difficult, with some very precise flying required at times (probably even more difficult than Defender or Stargate). It also has more of a "plot" than the arcade games it is based on, with several sub-missions of rescue depending on what stage you are at (it should be noted that there is no breaks between "stages" - the whole game play is continuous).</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Having discovered the Great Lost Pyramid beneath the desert sand, with the seal on its entrance still intact, you set up your computer to explore the undisturbed tomb. This modern "Astral Projection" technique of exploration puts at your command an Astral body for you to direct through the pyramid. It is as limited as your own body, and short in vocabulary. Your object is to collect all the treasures. And, of course, beware of the mummy!

Pyramid 2000 is a text adventure which shares most of its rooms, treasures, and puzzles with Adventure and Colossal Cave, but casts them in ancient Egyptian garb. The text parser accepts no more than two words at a time, so communicating with your astral projection is part of the puzzle.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>On a research grant for your Ph.D. project, you are searching for the lost Khazhadim tribe in the jungles of Nepal. An ancient woman interrupts your morning coffee both to point out the direction of the horrifying temple of the god, Raaka-Tu, and to beg you not to go there. Being a rational anthropologist, you disregard her warnings, accept the sign of good fortune she traces on your forehead, and set off alone into the impenetrable jungle.

In this text adventure your objective is to find and enter the temple, grab some artifacts, get out alive, and return to camp. The text parser handles prepositions, so interaction with objects can be relatively sophisticated. </synopsis>

To have any chance of this, he must locate a sacred suit of armor. Not only will this protect him from radiation, and allow him to withstand some enemy contact, it also heals him, and enables him to float.

This means that the game has two distinct styles, with your character limited to jumping, and with only rocks (located around the screens) to throw. Once he finds the suit he can fly around the ledges, shoot the inbuilt Pulsar beam, and survive within the volcanic hideout the aliens have based themselves. You will need to recharge the suit at times, and also take it off to pass through tight caverns.</synopsis>

In the dazzling future of the late 1990's, the world's first fusion reactor is online: energy particles are shooting out of emission tubes toward the energy posts... and missing. As each one passes the posts and strikes another tube on the opposite side of the core, the reactor moves one step closer to meltdown. The reflectoid is there; that's the solid energy deflection device which bounces the particles into the posts.

You begin each mission from the mother ship, and when your quota of pilots has been rescued you must return there so you can move on to the next level. To help locate the pilots and navigate the tricky terrain, your spaceship is equipped with various instruments, such as a compass, altimeter, and scanner.

Your enemy, the Jaggi's, have numerous forces on this planet and will be attempting to stop you. Gun emplacements, flying saucers, and the Jaggi themselves are all capable of destroying your ship if you don't destroy them first. To defend yourself from these threats, your ship is equipped with torpedoes. As the levels progress, the Jaggi defenses become more aggressive, and you will even need to fly some night missions where visibility is limited.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Patrolman Alex Murphy was killed on the streets of Detroit. The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Roman Checkers is a computer conversion of the board game Reversi (or Othello as it is also known). It's a two player game where players take turns in putting out stones on a 8x8 grid. One player has black stones and the other has white. For each round the player puts out one stone on the board and will then trap all of the opponent's stones that are enclosed between the player's stones. The opponent's stones will then change colour to the one of the player. The game ends when the board is full and the player with most stones in his colour will win.

Roman Checkers can be played either human vs. human or human vs. computer. It's controlled with either joystick or keyboard.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Rommel 3-D is a Battlezone variant. The player controls a tank from a first-person perspective and can move freely around a flat environment where various geometric objects act as obstacles. The aim of the game is to score points by shooting the tanks that appear on the battlefield one at a time. There are two different tanks: dumb ones which are worth 1,000 points and smart ones which are worth 1,500 points. Additionally there are planes which attempt to crash into the player that are worth 1,300 points. The smart tanks move quicker and have the same level of manoeuvrability as the player. To aid the player in finding the enemies a radar shows their positions. The player starts with three lives and one is lost when getting hit by an enemy. A new tank is awarded for each 10,000 points earned up till 100,000 points and thereafter every 20,000 points.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Rupert Rythym is an original arcade game, with some similarities in concept to the arcade hit Q*Bert. In this game, you have a "master" screen, with doors to the other 16 rooms. In these 16 rooms, there are multiple platforms and elevators scattered around... you must change the floor color (similiar to Q*Bert) by walking over it, while dodging monsters (you can't kill them). You also have a timer running, that subtracts points the longer it takes you to complete a screen. You do have firecrackers to scare off your opponents, and Pep pills that allow you to temporarily walk over your opponents without dieing. You also can not fall too far off of a platform, or you will die as well. Once you complete an entire room, you receive a small chunk of percussive music. After completing all 16 screens, you assemble the percussive chunks to make a complete song, and you get a little mini-concert.</synopsis>

The complex has a very strong radiation field, which means you must keep on moving unless you want to die just from ambient radiation.You carry a beam weapon, whose beam can extend across the entire screen. The longer you fire it, though, you expose yourself to more radiation. Use the weapon to destroy turrets and power generators which sustain force fields which block your way. Different hostile creatures will also patrol the complex and try to kill you. At certain locations, you are unable to use your gun. Beside that, the main component of the game is to use the platforms and lifts to get to the right place where you can shut off a generator so that you can reach the next generator whose forcefield shuts your path to your mates off.At the end of each level, the radiation you have absorbed is removed, and you receive one of the aliens' secret TRG-5 attack saucer sub-assemblies which must be brought back to your allies.</synopsis>

Donkey King).One of the most cloned games must be Konami's Scramble, and a staggering number of those clones were called Skramble with a K. This version of Skramble is Microdeal's rendition for the Dragon 32 and Tandy Colour.Apart from the obvious hardware limitations, this is a rather faithful copy of the original shooter. you fly your spaceship through a cave system (split up on five sections) filled with missiles that launch from the ground, radar installations and disturbing objects that fly in your path.

On each level, the player must push crates (from square to square) to get them onto designated spots; once each crate is on a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Spidercide is a shoot 'em up game where the player has ended up on a planet inhabited by enormous spiders. The game is played from a top down perspective with controls similar to Asteroids where the player's task is simply to shoot down the spiders before getting killed. As the spiders move around the screen they leave a trail of web that can trap the player. It is possible to shoot through it but each shot will only clear a small part of it. There are two different spiders, slow and fast, and both can weave straight or jagged webs. It's necessary to be extra careful with the ones producing jagged webs since they will seek out and chase the player. Any contact with a spider leads to a life being lost. There are three lives but extra ones are given upon reaching 1000 points.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Springster is an original arcade strategy game. It is sort of a cross between Q*Bert and Crystal Castles, although more complicated. There are many different objects to pick up, and each specially colored square has a special purpose or power. There is also 32 different levels ('planes'), which are all layed out differently. You control a spring, and you can only move up and down between levels of squares if the space between them is quite small, making movement difficult at times.</synopsis>

      <genre>Simulation,Shooter</genre>
      <synopsis>As a merchant in the distant future, you captain a starship from system to system, visiting starports to buy and sell cargo until you amass one thousand credits and retire to the quiet life. Fuel, upkeep, and even computer access contribute to overhead expenses. Pirates will get in your way and do costly damage to your ship or even end your career if your aim is slow. When money runs short, however, you can always scoop fuel from a red giant star or swipe some cargo from the ship a few bays down. If you make your deliveries on time, your reputation will bring you better fees.

The emphasis of the game is economic; ship-to-ship combat is purely a gallery shoot with moving targets and a possibility of escape. All play is real-time, so even in the starport, your fuel is being used and delivery dates are getting closer. Care must be taken in selecting cargo, as some runs will lose you money for the amount of fuel they consume. Run out of fuel in mid-jump and you're space salvage. Everything happens on one, tripartite game screen showing the view outside your ship, your status (cash, fuel, repair, date, etc.), and the graphical menu below.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Stellar Life Line is a side scrolling shoot 'em up where the player's task is to escort a fleet of space ships from one star base to another. The game is similar to Defender with the player being able to move both back and forth and having a scanner showing the locations of ships and obstacles. There are three different obstacles (asteroids, magnetic mines and alien ships) that the player has to shoot down since any collision will lead to a loss of one of the fleet ship. The fleet ships are also destroyed when running out of fuel which happens as they are hit by enemy fire. Refuelling is possible by manoeuvring the player's ship over one of the ships in the fleet. Some attackers can attach itself to a fleet ship to do a sneak attack and steal the ship.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Stellar Life Line is an original game by Steve Bjork that was sold in cartridge form through Radio Shack. The premise is for you to protect a convoy of 6 fuel ships as you traverse across the entire space lane (see the radar at the bottom of the game screenshot). There are 3 levels; the first level consists of meteors that you must destroy before they hit your convoy ships. On later levels, actual alien craft are added to the mix, and some of them will steal the convoy ships, splitting your convoy all over the place, and making it very difficult to guard them all.</synopsis>

      <title>Polaris</title>
      <genre>Shooter</genre>
      <synopsis>Three submarines, endless missiles raining down. How long can you protect your islands by firing interceptor missiles? Defeat is inevitable, as the incoming missiles increase in speed and density. Some will suddenly split into multiple warheads targeting multiple islands, and if you survive long enough, the smart bombs will come out, capable of evading your interceptors. Your only advantages are the broad, area effect of your missiles, replacement islands awarded as your score races upward, and the lightning-fast, hand-eye coordination given by your ancestors just for playing video games like this one.

A ROM cartridge, Polaris presents the standard elevation view of a Missile Command game, placing three submarines among six islands. Islands and submarines alike are targeted by missiles dropping from the top of the screen; destroyed subs come back the next round, and islands are replaced every 2000 points. Points are awarded for surviving islands, submarines, and interceptor missiles, multiplied by the level's difficulty. Interesting effects include color set changes which can camouflage incoming missiles, explosions which endure in mid-air as additional missiles reach the area, and explosions which wrap around from one edge of the screen to the other.

Hot-seat, two-player play is possible, split by round with competing scores shown at the top of the screen. The manual even makes tongue-in-cheek mention that the scores can be targeted and blown up, but to no effect.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The original commercially-licensed version of Alexey Pajitnov's classic Tetris puzzle game.  Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears.  If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over.  Difficulty increases by dropping the pieces faster and faster over time.Tetris is a verifiable classic game, translated to well over 200 electronic and computer platforms.  It takes 2 minutes to learn, but a lifetime to master.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.Having nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced variation on the good old Gauntlet concept. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.Each of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).Interestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction. Gaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Gauntlet (obviously), Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Tower of Fear is a text adventure by Charles Forsythe. The goal is to enter the Wizard's Tower of Fear, get the treasures, and escape alive. The Wizards who dwell in Graylock, powerful necromancers, caused terror in the hearts of all. As the years passed, they gradually succumbed to death - but some of the most powerful ones delayed it by hiding themselves in huge towers, beyond the sun, beyond time, surrounding themselves with magic. But eventually, death came for them still. The last of these was Blackheart Firethrower, with an awesome fortress that none could penetrate. Some say his undead spirit still roams in his Tower of Fear.

The game contains a single graphic screen at the beginning (a drawing of the tower) and only exists of text against a blank background for the rest of the game.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Trapfall, or as it is known on the Dragon 32, Cuthbert in the Jungle, is a direct clone of Activision's classic Pitfall. In a red, blue, yellow and green jungle, your hero (Cuthbert) must run through the landscape, avoiding falling into lakes (some of which appear out of nothing, only to disappear again), being crushed by rolling logs, being bit by snakes, scorpions or other dangerous creatures of the jungle. In the lakes live crocodiles, which can be used as stepping stones as long as their jaws are closed. In order to cross lakes, lianas may also be used, Tarzan-style. For some reason, there is a big cellar beneath the jungle into which Cuthbert may fall. It may be used as a way to avoid the dangers on the surface, but it is also inhabited by nasties, and you may run into a cul-de-sac. To spice things up, you only have 20 minutes to reach the end.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Tube Frenzy is an original arcade/strategy game. With multiple skills levels, your object is to steer the yellow ball using the diagonal deflectors, that you can rotate by hitting the right Joystick button, to run over all of the flashing squares. You can also control the speed of the ball, etc. by using the right joystick by moving it up and down. At the same time, there are some one-way paths (both horizontal and vertical), and blocked paths as well, as well as roving monsters that kill you if they contact your ball. You also have a time limit to worry about. An addicting and very original game.
Unlike most other Dave Edson games, there are no hidden messages in the code.</synopsis>

      <title>Varloc</title>
      <genre>Strategy,Board game</genre>
      <synopsis>Varloc is a chess-like strategy game with some similarities to Archon: The Light and the Dark. The game takes place on a board consisting of 64 squares where the player competes against a computer controlled evil wizard called Varloc. On each side there are sixteen warriors: a witch, a sorcerer's apprentice, a minotaur, two archers, two knights, four dwarfs and four trolls. Like in chess each warrior is only allowed certain moves. To win the game it is necessary to defeat the enemy's wizard. If the player manages to find a hidden gem, it is possible to kill Varloc with a single hit.

When two warriors clash on the board the game moves to a battlefield where the player has to defeat Varloc's warrior in a one-on-one duel. Unlike the battles of Archon, the game uses wireframe 3D graphics displayed from a first person perspective. Each warrior has its own way of attacking and defending. The minotaur rams into opponents while knights attack with a sword and can defend with a shield. Dwarfs can disappear at will while the wizard, the witch and the apprentice can shapeshift into three deadly animals: bat, snake or spider. The wizard can also turn into any of the other warriors.</synopsis>

      <title>Venturer</title>
      <genre>Action,Arcade</genre>
      <synopsis>Venturer is a clone of the arcade game Venture. There are two basic areas in Venturer: The main hall (where you can not fire back), where you have to dodge roaming monsters to get into the four rooms, and the four rooms themselves, where you can attack monsters back, and have to collect treasures. Once you kill a monster, it becomes a cross for a few seconds... if you collide with the cross, you die. Also, if you linger in one of the treasure rooms for too long, some indestructable lines will come down. If you get hit by one, you die, and they can also cut you off from the exit (an example of this is shown in the screenshot on the lower right). This last bit is a bit different than the original arcade game; in the original, an indestructable monster that can fly through walls (similiar to the "Evil Otto" character from the arcade game Berzerk) came to kill you instead.
Unlike most other Dave Edson games, there are no hidden messages in the binary for this game.</synopsis>

Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? is a game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country. This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away.

Along with finding out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members, eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.</synopsis>

      <genre>Simulation</genre>
      <synopsis>Worlds of Flight is a civilian flight simulator depicting a single engine trainer aircraft, limited aerobatics capable, and equipped with steerable and retractable gear.

The scenery is organized in 9 adjoining maps called 'worlds' plus a common airport scenery that recurs on every map. The views are drawn as wire graphics to save memory, and you can cross from one map to another to make longer flights. The worlds/maps have 3D objects like towers and mountain that needs to be avoided or navigated by, and there are beacons that let you use IFR instruments to find the airports. There is a 'radar' view to help check your position on the map in IMC training.

The game starts with setting the weather in the worlds, with winds/cloud ceilings and then you move to the aircraft at the airport. Your view is from inside the cockpit, and to look around the view can be shifted 90 degrees to either side, and 8 degrees up relative to the aircraft orientation/pitch. In steep climbs the view/head angle is adjusted (to a limit) to try and keep the horizon visible.

The Worlds are called: Mountain World #1, Arabian Gulf, Panama City, Dahlgren VA, Practice Field, Mountain World #2, Island Bay, Mountain World #3, Power Line River. The airport scenery is loaded whenever you get close enough, below the ceiling/400ft and about 4000ft from the runway threshold.

The instrument panel has:

• Elevator Trim Indicator
• Fuel Gauge - there are refuelling areas on the airfield if you need to refuel during long flights.
• Indicated Air Speed - IAS (kts) - can be switched to Ground Speed indication for fun, but that is not recommended for flying.
• Tachometer (rpm)
• Stall Indicator (and a tone)
• Artificial Horizon (gyroscope)
• Sideslip indicator (ball)
• Altimeter (the runway is always at 0 ft height)
• Compass, with a special turn rate indication, it inverts when you do a 3deg/s (2min) turn, which is helpful in IMC.
• Rate of climb indicator (ft/min)
• Brake indicator (for holding still at run-up, and stopping)
• Gear Indicator
• Rudder, Aileron, Elevator Indicators
• Keyboard/Joystick indicator, mode is switchable in flight.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Z-89 is the Coco 3 only version of Zaxxon, by the same author (Steve Bjork) who did the original, officially licensed version from Datasoft. This game was released twice (with some slight changes), once when sold by Game Point Software, and then directly by SRB Software after Game Point folded a short time after.
   The basic play of Z-89 is that you have to destroy the Zaxxon robot at the end of the two floating space fortresses, while defending yourself from planes, tanks, missiles, and colliding with terrain. You have to keep your fuel topped up as well, by shooting fuel tanks. The game is played in isometric 3D, showing you flying at an angle, where you can fly side to side and up and down (you are always moving forward). Z-89 adds one new twist to Zaxxon: in the space sequence (between the two floating space fortresses), in addition to planes coming after you, you also have meteors to contend with.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</synopsis>
