      <title>1552 Tenka Tairan</title>
      <synopsis>1552 Tenka Tairan is a war strategy game (with MOUSE support!) set during the Sengoku period of the Japanese history. The three campaign scenarios are set, respectively, in the years 1552, 1582, and 1600. The player is put in the midst of the so-called gekokujou situation, when ambitious daimyo (feudal lords) began to overthrow their superiors, resulting in a global war for dominance in Japan. The player controls such a warlord, choosing one of the available historical figures, or creating his/her own character. Character creation is Ultima-style; the player is asked a series of questions, and depending on the answer, the player-controlled general will have different statistics.

The gameplay involves managing the army, advancing the troops, conquering neighboring provinces, defending own castle, etc. Though the game pauses when the player makes a decision, the time advances regardless of the player's actions, effectively making Tenka Tairan a real-time strategy game. Battles take place on separate screens, with a wealth of tactical possibilities for positioning and maneuvering the troops.</synopsis>

El proceso de creación se asemeja al estilo de los juegos tipo Ultima, donde se le presetan al jugador una serie de preguntas que responder y en función de sus respuestas varian las estadísticas del general controlado.

El modo de juego incluye administrar el ejército, mover tropas, conquistar territorios, defender sus castillos, etc. Aunque el juego se pausa cuando el jugador ha de tomar una decisión, el tiempo avanza sin tener en cuenta las acciones del jugador, por lo que se considera un juego de estrategia en tiempo real.

      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>Sanjiyan Henjō is based on the manga and anime series 3x3 Eyes. Pai, a young girl from the immortal tribe of sanzhiyan, three-eyed demons of Chinese origin, wants to become a human again. She meets a Japanese teenager named Yakumo Fujii, whom she accidentally turns into a "wu", an immortal obedient servant of a three-eyed demon. Together, Pai and Yakumo try to regain their lost humanity.

This game can be considered a side-story to the series. The player does not control Yakumo, but an ordinary high-school student named Kenichi Yamamoto. Accidentally, Kenichi comes into contact with the world of demons, and now he needs the help of Pai and Yakumo to be freed.

The gameplay is standard Japanese-style adventure. The player interacts with the game world by selecting menu commands "Look", "Talk", and "Move". The game features animated cutscenes and (in its console incarnation) voice-overs.</synopsis>

      <title>Addams Family, The</title>
      <synopsis>Based on the Addams Family movie, this game is quite different from the other Addams Family variants. The player is cast in the role of Tully Alford, the crooked lawyer of the Addams family. He finds out that somewhere in the family mansion, a great treasure is stored in a vault. He decides to venture into the mansion and retrieve the treasure. Naturally, this is going to be anything but easy, as the insane Addams family members and a legion of ghosts and monsters are there to make sure the lawyer fails...

Like most other Addams Family incarnations, this is a side-scrolling action game. Tully Alford's only weapon is an umbrella that fires energy shots at enemies. Tully can also jump and duck to avoid enemy blows. The game world consists of a "hub" area, the hall of Addams Family mansion, and many rooms, most of which are locked in the beginning of the game. The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the accessible rooms and collecting keys that are needed to open other doors in the process. Some of the rooms contain treasure and power-ups, while others are infested by monsters or require the player to defeat a boss enemy in order to advance.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Basé sur le film "La Famille Adams" le joueur y dirige Tully Alford, l'avocat tordu de la famille Addams. Il découvre que quelque part dans le manoir familial, un grand trésor est entreposé dans un coffre-fort. Il décide alors de s'aventurer dans le manoir et de récupérer le trésor. 

Comme la plupart des autres jeux basés sur "la famille Addams", il s'agit d'un jeu d'action à défilement horizontal. La seule arme de Tully est un parapluie qui tire des coups d'énergie sur les ennemis. Tully peut aussi sauter et se baisser pour éviter les coups ennemis. Le gameplay consiste principalement à explorer les salles accessibles et à collecter les clés nécessaires pour ouvrir d'autres portes. Certaines salles contiennent des trésors et des bonus, tandis que d'autres sont infestées de monstres ou exigent du joueur qu'il triomphe d'un boss ennemi pour avancer.</synopsis>

      <title>Advanced V.g.</title>
      <synopsis>Set in a near-future version of Japan, the games tell the story of a martial arts tournament created to determine the country's strongest woman. The tournaments are sponsored by a number of family restaurants, who in exchange for their sponsorship, are given promotion in the form of having a tournament entry work as a waitress. As a result of the popularity of the tournaments, the restaurants experience a boom in patronage.

The winner of the tournament is awarded the title "Virgin Goddess", as well as a large cash prize of ten billion yen, and a house erected anywhere on the planet they should choose. However, when a given waitress is defeated, they are required to publicly strip themselves of their clothing (self-fondling and public masturbation may be forced upon the loser, and in the most extreme cases, the loser is raped/gang-raped, either in private or in front of an audience), in order to teach the so-called "true" shame of defeat. In spite of such humiliation, the tournaments often draw many competitors, each placing their pride and their dreams on the line as they battle for the top.</synopsis>

      <title>Adventure Quiz - Capcom World + Hatena No Daibouken</title>
      <synopsis>Adventure Quiz is a compilation of two games previously released on the arcades, Capcom World and Hatena? no Daiboken.

Both games play very similarly: the player has to roll dice in order to navigate his/her alter ego on a board with medieval/fantasy backgrounds. Depending on the result, the character advances a certain amount of squares, which lead to various quiz challenges. The player has to answer a series of questions within a time limit, choosing the right answer among the several (usually four) available ones. Two-player gameplay is also possible.

Upon reaching the final square of a "world", the player has to face a "boss enemy" (usually a character from popular games by Capcom, such as Side Arms, Forgotten Worlds, etc.). The boss offers the player a choice of several available topics for the decisive quiz. "Defeating" the boss leads the player into a new worlds with its own structure, etc.

The themes of the questions are varied, ranging from history and geography to Japanese popular culture and very specific themes (such as bicycles).

Hatena? no Daiboken is a follow-up to Capcom World, offering a few enhancements: multiple paths through some worlds, special squares that lead to new challenges (such as a quiz with only three possible answers), etc.</synopsis>

Les deux jeux se ressemblent beaucoup: le joueur doit lancer des dés pour avancer sur un plateau . En fonction du résultat, le personnage avance d'un certain nombre de cases , ce qui conduit à différents défis de quiz. Le joueur doit répondre à une série de questions dans un délai déterminé, en choisissant la bonne réponse parmi les nombreuses (en général quatre) disponibles. Un jeu à deux joueurs est également possible.

Lorsqu'il atteint la dernière case d'un "monde", le joueur doit faire face à un "chef ennemi" (généralement un personnage de jeux populaires de Capcom, tels que Side Arms, Forgotten Worlds, etc.). 
Les thèmes des questions sont variés, allant de l'histoire et la géographie à la culture populaire japonaise, en passant par des thèmes très spécifiques (tels que le vélo).</synopsis>

It's a shoot ?em up, with the player taking the role of an almost nude muscle-man (Adon) or his brother (Samson) in a 2 player game. Their main weapon is a ball of energy that grows over a hole in their heads and shoots out towards any advancing enemies. Other, more powerful shots are achieved by a combination of back-forward-fire, down-up-fire etc on the pad. Through the levels you will encounter all manner of nasties out to get you, but you are aided by a woman in blue that flies around and drops power-ups conveniently for you. Also, levels vary from the standard left-to-right to vertically scrolling.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Anesan is a beat 'em up featuring an exclusively female cast; you start out with three characters (Ai, Chika, and Makoto) all members of a gang, and you fight other gangs to expand your territory.  Depending on who you use to beat the bosses (generally Ai) some of them will join you afterwards. Each character plays slightly differently and has a different special move. If a character gets KO'd in a stage, they must spend a day of game time recovering (I.E., one stage) before they can be used again. If all characters are KO'd at the same time, it results in a game over. 
 In addition to the basic beat 'em up mode, it features two mini-games and you can customize Ai's room (which also gives your characters various stat boosts). Sometimes Ai has strange dreams between the stages; this appears to be random. </synopsis>

Si un des personnage est mis KO dans un stage , il doit passer une journée à récupérer (une journée équivaut en fait a un stage) avant de pouvoir être utilisé à nouveau. Si tous les personnages sont KO en même temps, le jeu est terminé.

 En plus du mode de base Ane-San comporte deux mini-jeux et vous pouvez personnaliser la salle de Ai (qui donne également à vos personnages diverses améliorations de statistiques). Parfois, Ai a des rêves étranges entre les étapes; cela semble être aléatoire.</synopsis>

      <title>Arunamu No Kiba</title>
      <synopsis>Kenbu is a young warrior who trains in the art of shape-shifting - his people possess the ability to turn into beasts. One day, his home village is attacked by a hideous spider-like monster. Kenbu's best friend and mentor dies protecting him. The young hero kills the monster, but soon thereafter has to leave the village and find out who or what was behind that attack. Kenbu encounters other heroes, and together they must stop the evil that is threatening the entire world.

Alnam no Kiba ("Fang of Alnam") is a traditional Japanese RPG. Kenbu and his party roam the top-down world, walking on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The battles are viewed from the same top-down perspective as the navigation (like in Alshark). Every action in battle depletes a certain amount of spirit points. The heroes can use regular attacks, magic, and unite attacks, that do high damage to all enemies, but consume a lot of spirit points.</synopsis>

      <title>Aurora Quest - Otaku No Seiza In Another World</title>
      <synopsis>Foregoing the generic fantasy setting of most RPGs, Aurora Quest casts you as Otaku-chan, a man in a land controlled by a group of five women called Aurora (who would pass quite easily for a Japanese girlie band). Together with your fellow travellers, Jonjon and Nekketsu, you work your way through a humorous sci-fi story. The gameplay is very standard RPG stuff with towns containing shops, hotels and so on, and the world map throwing up random encounters every few steps. These battles are turn based with the usual mechanics of selecting your attacks and watching them play out - although you have to choose carefully, as you don't default to the next available target when one is destroyed, which will often have you shooting into thin air.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Following the usual plots of this kind of game (2061...Evil government...etc) Avenger is one of the earlier shooters on CD. It's a vertically scrolling affair, with you controlling an advanced helicopter over many stages of shooting mayhem. The weapon system is slightly different from the norm; you get to choose the type of weapon at the beginning of the level (from primary, secondary and special) and this stays with you until the next level starts. During the game, you do get little power up ships that upgrade your current weapon or shield status when you blow 'em up and collect a pod. These pods cycle through the various options so timing is essential (M=primary, S=secondary, R=shield). At certain points in the game, you get to choose which stage to play next and as stages are completed, your range of weapons to choose from increases.</synopsis>

But an accident happened, and the humans were thrown into a parallel universe. Years have passed until they have adapted themselves to the different civilization. This parallel world, composed of three huge continents, is called Babel. Zell is a teenage boy, an orphan who lives in a post-apocalyptic world riding his bike, together with his friend Alice, who is like a big sister to him. One day they meet a mysterious girl named Sefia who seems to be on an important mission. Their struggle against evil begins at that moment...

Babel is a Japanese-style RPG set in a futuristic world. Zell and his party travel around the world, visiting large cities and encountering many randomly appearing enemies. During the turn-based battles, each character can use a variety of attacks with different weapons, as well as special techniques. The combat window shows animated moves of the party members. Unlike in most role-playing games, characters do not receive experience points from defeating enemies; only money is gained. The characters level up according to the player's progress in the narrative.</synopsis>

The unlikely hero is transported to the prehistoric era, where he must set things right with the local tribe and dangerous wildlife.

The game consists of non-interactive comic book-style scenes with voice-overs, as well as short, very simple adventure-like segments. During these segments the player has five icons at his disposal, each corresponding to a context-specific action. Only one of these actions can solve the problem at hand, but others trigger humorous animations and allow the player to proceed even if the result was fatal</synopsis>

The game features real wrestlers from the time period it was released in. The wrestlers appear as digitized photos in the intro sequence and on the character selection screens; during gameplay, they are rendered as 2D graphical images.

The game has four gameplay modes; the "battle mode" allows the player to choose one wrestler and compete against opponents chosen and controlled by the computer AI. The other modes correspond to a league, a cup (knock-out stages only), and a "versus" mode, in which the player can also choose any opponent to compete against. In every mode, the player is able to choose between single match (one-on-one) and tag team, with an additional wrestler on each side. The league mode allows competition between up to four players.

The combat system is similar to that of fighting games, with a side view and health bars for the wrestlers.</synopsis>

      <title>Bazaru Degozaru No Game Degozaru</title>
      <synopsis>Bazaru de Gozaru no Game de Gozaru is a puzzle game starring a monkey protagonist named Bazaru. The concept of the game is remotely similar to that of Lemmings: the player's task is to "program" the actions of the hero in order to safely traverse a stage full of traps and hazards. Unlike Lemmings, there is only one primate to control in this game; also, the player's "programming" must be performed before letting the monkey loose, unlike the real-time player input in Lemmings.

The player basically orders the monkey what to do at specific spots (which are highlighted by exclamation marks on the level map). In the beginning the levels are short and simple, and the monkey can perform only one action. As the game advances, the puzzles become more and more complex, and so is the amount of actions the monkey must perform to reach safety.</synopsis>

Contrairement à Lemmings, il n'y a qu'un seul primate à contrôler dans ce jeu !Le joueur demande généralement au singe quoi faire à des endroits spécifiques (qui sont mis en évidence par des points d'exclamation dans le niveau). Au début, les niveaux sont courts et simples et le singe ne peut effectuer qu'une seule action. Au fur et à mesure que le jeu avance, les énigmes deviennent de plus en plus complexes, de même que le nombre d'actions que le singe doit effectuer pour atteindre la fin du niveau.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The game's structure mimics collection of Bikkuriman stickers. The original stickers had different values; the bizarre Bikkuriman characters were divided into three classes (Angels, Protectors, and Demons), and the highest-rated (and rarest) stickers were the so-called "Heads", mostly bearing names from various mythologies and religions ("Super Zeus", "Maria", etc.). In the game, the player can view a number of the more "ordinary" stickers; the "head" is available only after having answered a trivia question correctly. 

Each "head" unlocks a map part of the Bikkuriman world; each part, in its turn, unlocks a series of short non-interactive scenes from the anime, accompanied by narration.</synopsis>

      <title>Black Hole Assault</title>
      <synopsis>According to Blackhole Assault, the 22nd century sees earth technology advance to the point where exploration of the immediate solar system is not only possible, but necessary due to resource constraints. Humans are attempting to harvest the resources of the entire solar system but have met with trouble from alien invaders. It is up to a small force of humans who recognize and understand the threat to confront the aliens head on.

The weapon of choice in this game is the Cybernetic Anthropomorphized Machine, or C.A.M. The C.A.M. is a large robot that fights 1-on-1 against alien robots. All of the gameplay in Blackhole Assault revolves around single-round, 1-on-1 robot fighting action. There are 10 backdrops against which to beat up robots, including various planets and moons around the solar system.

The game has 4 different modes. The main story mode is Operation BHA. The exhibition mode allows players to customize matches down to the robots each player will use and the backdrop to play on. The exhibition mode can be configured to allow one or even both fighters to be controlled by the computer. Further, the game has tournament and league modes.</synopsis>

      <title>Blood Gear</title>
      <synopsis>The Deguna Empire is terrorizing the planets and their inhabitants, using their unbeaten military force consisting of "Powered Gears", giant combat robots piloted by human fighters from the inside. One day, a squad of Empire robots assaulted a laboratory, in which two scientists were working on their own Powered Gear project. One of the scientists, heavily wounded, still managed to deliver a Powered Gear control device to his young apprentice Aref, before he died from his wounds. Enraged, Aref swears revenge to the Empire and everything it represents. With his own new Powered Gear, and perhaps a few allies who think alike, the idea might not be as suicidal as it sounded first...

Blood Gear is a role-playing game with action-based combat. The general gameplay system is somewhat similar to that of the Exile series: town exploration is performed from the standard "RPG-like" top-down view, while all hostile areas are presented as side-scrolling levels, sometimes with elaborate platform structures. 

The player fights enemy robots in real-time combat, similarly to a regular side-scrolling action game. Player-controlled Powered Gear can be equipped with a variety of weapons. Both melee and ranged weapons (pistols, assault rifles, laser guns, etc.) can be purchased in stores and/or found while exploring hostile areas. Health is restored with repair kits of various efficiency, which can also be purchased, found, or randomly dropped by enemies.

Each time an enemy is defeated, the player is rewarded points. There is no separation between money and experience points in this game; the same kind of points is used to buy items, repair and upgrade the Powered Gear. In factories, the player can choose to upgrade the Powered Gear in one of the three categories: body, arms, and legs. Each of these categories has three sub-categories of its own, influencing speed, strength, and other parameters of the body part. Each upgrade cost a certain amount of points; it can also be reversed, and the points invested in another upgrade.

To make "power leveling" possible, enemies re-spawn whenever the player-controlled Powered Gear enters an area, and sometimes even if he walks off the screen and comes back.</synopsis>

Afterwards, they began producing giant combat robots, evidently prepared to build an entire army and become the most dominant military power on the Earth. It's time to stop them! The young hero, piloting a giant combat robot of his own, is sent to Sea Square precisely for that reason...

Browning is a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls the giant robot, equipped with a single gun (with unlimited ammunition), and must fight waves of enemies (mostly of a robotic kind), and eventually the stage boss. Short cut scenes appear between the stages. The player-controlled robot has the ability to hover in the air (the player has to repeatedly press a button to make the robot keep the height). The hit points of the robot depend on the condition of its shield. When the robot stands still, shield energy recharges slowly. Complete loss of shield energy makes the robot so vulnerable that the next hit destroys it. The player is given unlimited continues, but must return to the beginning of the stage each time the robot is destroyed.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Browning est un shooter à défilement horizontal. Le joueur contrôle un robot géant équipé d'un seul fusil (avec des munitions illimitées), et doit combattre des vagues d'ennemis (principalement de type robotique), et éventuellement un Boss. Le robot contrôlé par le joueur a la capacité de survoler dans le niveau  (le joueur doit appuyer plusieurs fois sur un bouton pour que le robot garde la hauteur). Les points de vie du robot dépendent de l'état de son bouclier. Lorsque le robot reste immobile, l'énergie du bouclier se recharge lentement. La perte totale d'énergie du bouclier rend le robot si vulnérable que le coup suivant le détruit.</synopsis>

The aim is to escort your little buddy across the vast playing area without him getting stuck, burned up, eaten by sheep etc. To do this, you can pick up and move various items that are scattered around the landscape, such as blocks to fill in gaps or create handy slopes, bombs to destroy areas of the map and so on. All this time your red headed friend is moving forward with alarming rapidity towards his doom. Thankfully, you can freeze the action to give yourself some breathing space to juggle things around, but this is limited to a timer which counts down slowly at the top of the screen.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Before the eight heroes unite for their ultimate journey, you play their introductory stories. You travel on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons on your way. The combat is turn-based, viewed from first person perspective. Enemies appear randomly. Each hero has his/her own unique techniques to use in battles.

The story and general gameplay of Burai: Hachigyoku no Y?shi Densetsu is similar to those of the original Burai: J?kan for computers; however, the console versions were developed from scratch and therefore differ greatly from the computer ones, having new cutscenes, dialogues, battle interface, etc. Perhaps the most important difference gameplay-wise is the linear nature of chapters. In the computer versions, the player can choose to start as any of the eight selectable heroes; in the console versions, the player has to start with Gonza and Maimai.</synopsis>

Seventeen years later, Sayaka, the young heiress of the Asano family, forms a group together with her friends Miki and Kyoko, and the three begin looking for the lost treasure. Heist after heist goes by unsuccessfully. Eventually, the girls organize a TV show, challenging dubious personalities to card games, hoping to find the Sorcerer's Trump in process.

Cardangels is a card game in which the player takes the roles of the three friends, playing cards against young, attractive female opponents. Four types of card games are available: poker, blackjack, speed, and babanuki (a variant of old maid). A slot machine-like introduction determines which games are played against which opponents. The player can select the amount of rounds (minimum ten) needed to win a game and advance to the next opponent. The "free play" mode allows the player to choose the type of game actively, but the amount of available opponents is lower. There is no gambling in any of the games; points are awarded for combinations in poker and blackjack. The opponents undress after losing a game; however, they retain their underwear - there is no explicit nudity in the game.</synopsis>

      <title>Chiki Chiki Boys</title>
      <synopsis>This platform-based action game is set in the land of Alurea. The idyllic life of the Alurean people was shattered when the King is killed by a dragon, and a range of nasties inhabit the lands. Fortunately his twin sons have come to the rescue, and you must take control of one or the other to put the world right.

The boys have differing skills - one is more skilled in sword-fighting (which you are always armed with), the other in magic (available in limited amounts on each level). You collect coins as the game goes on, and spend these in the shop on extra magic, extra lives and enhanced swords.

There are 3 levels on offer - Earth, The Heavens and The Sea, and these can be tackled in any order. The first is straight platform action, the second involves jumping across clouds, and the third sees your characters swim. After those are completed, you must venture into the Monster Castle and finally slay the dragon.</synopsis>

Very soon he realizes that the bounty Jane has been hunting for is his own head, for which the Galaxy Patrol has put quite a reward. But everything changes when Crystal Boy, the head of the Pirate Guild and Cobra's archenemy, appears on the scene. Jane's father had apparently hidden a great treasure, encoding its location in tattoos on the backs of his triplet daughters. Crystal Boy wants this treasure, and is going after Jane and her sisters.

      <title>Color Wars</title>
      <synopsis>Color Wars is a puzzle game in which up to four players try to win by putting colored balls on poles, converting adjacent balls to their color. Each stage consists of a rotatable 3D screen containing a number of poles of the same height. Players take turns in placing balls onto these poles. Adjacent balls (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) can be "captured" and hence change their color. Points are awarded per ball of each color. The round ends when there is no more place on the poles to put balls onto, and the player with the most points wins.

The story mode begins with an introduction depicting a powerful demon that can only be vanquished by traveling to the Color World; a young pilot ventures there and must defeat opponents in the Color Wars game at each stage. This mode puts one player against three AI-controlled opponents; the free mode also allows four human players to compete against each other. Two-player mode can be played by either two human players or one player against computer AI.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The gameplay is dungeon crawling, with an overhead viewpoint and turn-based battles. The one distinguishing feature is in the predictability of the battles: all of the enemies, even the bosses, are unable to use spells, items, or special moves of any sort, and are restricted to performing a normal attack each turn. Furthermore, neither enemies nor player characters can miss with attacks, and there are no critical hits aside from certain weapons which unleash spell attacks on random turns. This leaves the enemies' choice of target for each of their attacks as the one element of uncertainty in battles.</synopsis>

      <title>Cotton - Fantastic Night Dreams</title>
      <synopsis>Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams plays in a similar way to other scrolling shooter video games such as R-Type. What distinguishes Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams from other games of a similar ilk is its bright colourful graphics and its lead character, Cotton. The game also takes place in a fantasy dream-like world instead of space like many other shooting games. The game can be compared to other fantasy Shoot 'em up games like Parodius. It bears most similarities in style to the Chariot game on Three Wonders.

The player controls Cotton, a young witch on a broomstick. The player must blast various monsters and avoid being shot. The player can collect power-ups to enhance their weaponry and unleash a more powerful attack on the enemy. The player has lives represented by an arrow. The player has three lives and is only allowed one hit per life.</synopsis>

      <title>Death Bringer - The Knight Of Darkness</title>
      <synopsis>A powerful wizard, yearning for even more power, has found a sacred book that granted him command over armies of demons and men. Possessed by the desire to conquer and to destroy, he orders his armies to set cities on fire, massacring the citizens. But one nameless hero, the protagonist of this game, has to stand up against the evil. Leaving Soron, his home village, the hero embarks on a journey to find companions and to face together the forces of darkness.

Despite being a Japanese game, Death Bringer is more similar to Western RPGs of the time than to their Japanese counterparts, even though it has anime-style character graphics. It is less event-oriented than Japanese games and focuses on exploration. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Pandora's RPG of the same name, even though the two games are unrelated. Both friendly and hostile areas are pseudo-3D, maze-like environments, like in Bard's Tale games. Enemy encounters, however, are handled more similarly to those of Ultima: the enemies appear on the exploration screen, and the battle initiates only if the player character approaches the enemy. The battles take place on a top-down field; the heroes and the enemies move around, but the player can't navigate the characters manually: it is only possible to issue commands such as "Attack", "Use Magic", etc. The game has a day/night cycle. Party members (up to three, excluding the hero) have to be sought out in various cities, rather then joining the hero for plot-related reasons.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Bien qu'il s'agisse d'un jeu japonais, Death Bringer ressemble plus au RPG occidental de son époque qu'à ses homologues japonais, bien qu'il présente des graphismes de caractère de style anime. Il est moins axé sur les événements que les jeux japonais et se concentre sur l'exploration. Le gameplay est un peu similaire au RPG de Pandore du même nom, même si les deux jeux ne sont pas liés. Les zones amicales et hostiles sont des environnements pseudo-3D, semblables à des labyrinthes, comme dans les jeux Bard's Tale. Les rencontres ennemies, cependant, sont traitées de manière plus semblable à celles d'Ultima: les ennemis apparaissent sur l'écran d'exploration et la bataille ne commence que si le personnage du joueur s'approche de l'ennemi.  les héros et les ennemis se déplacent, mais le joueur ne peut pas naviguer manuellement dans les personnages: il est uniquement possible de lancer des commandes telles que "Attaque", "Utiliser la magie", etc. Le jeu a un cycle jour/nuit. Les membres du parti (jusqu'à trois, à l'exclusion du héros) doivent être recherchés dans différentes villes, plutôt que de rejoindre le héros pour des raisons liées à l'intrigue.</synopsis>

      <genre>Action,Racing,Arcade,</genre>
      <synopsis>Dekoboko Densetsu is a humorous game that combines elements of arcade action and racing. Up to five players can compete in the races. All the stages are vertically-scrolling (top-down), with the cars represented as small sprites of different colors. The player's goal is not only to beat the other cars, but also reach the finish line safely: each car has limited hit points, and continuously receives damage during the race.

Damage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs, etc.), failing to move the car forward in time (if the screen scrolls while the player-controlled car is at the bottom, it takes damage), being hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy fire, avoiding damage.

Over the course of the races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in purchasing a limited amount of destructive weaponry (missiles, bombs, "boxing glove" that hits enemies from the side, oil to drop behind the car, etc.) or protective measures.</synopsis>

One day, Foltjunia is attacked and ends up unconscious on the pavement in one of the cities in Japan, planet Earth. There, she is found by a regular high-school student named Takaya. It appears that Foltjunia has lost her transformation abilities.

Having the same characters and initial plot as Hatsukoi Monogatari, Dennō Tenshi: Digital Ange is a Japanese-style adventure game with very limited interaction and strictly linear progression. Most screens allow the player to choose verb commands such as "Look", "Talk", "Watch", "Go", etc. from a menu, usually combining them with character and object names in a sub-menu.

Once again, the players assume the role of brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee, who are now tasked with the duty of avenging Marian's death. The arcade version of the game is essentially an improved version of the original title. The biggest change in the game's controls are in the replacement of the original's punch and kick buttons with two directional-based attack buttons (Left Attack and Right Attack) similar to Renegade. Pressing the attack button of the player's current direction will do a standard series of punches, while pressing the opposite attack button will perform a back kick. A few new moves are added as well, including a Hurricane Kick.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Download 2 is an horizontal shooter. Nec Avenue certainly acknowledged that the game's best asset was the unique and innovative ability to jack-in and dive into computerized cyber-space worlds. This sequel follows the same formula but also features probably one of most electrifying storyline ever written for a video game. The brain of Adolf Hitler has been digitized inside a computer mainframe by terrorists and Syd, an elite cyber-diver and protagonist of the game, embarks on a perilous journey to stop and destroy the incoming threat. On board his ship and helped by the cute Deva, Syd flies through nine enemy infested areas and dives into abstract and challenging cyber worlds. Four different weapons are available to him at the press of a button - multiway Vulcan-gun, wide laser-beams, spread homing-lasers and a short-range lightning gun. Each weapon can be powered-up a grand total of three times by collecting "P" pods that appear on the screen whereas "S" pods increase the overall speed of the ship. Other special items are available throughout the game such as smart-bombs and protective shields.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Download 2 est un jeu de tir horizontal. Nec Avenue a certainement reconnu que le meilleur atout du jeu était sa capacité unique et innovante à s'impliquer et à plonger dans des mondes cyber-espace informatisés. Cette suite suit la même formule mais comporte également probablement l'un des scénarios les plus électrisants jamais écrits pour un jeu vidéo. Le cerveau d'Adolf Hitler a été numérisé à l'intérieur d'un ordinateur central par des terroristes et Syd, cyber-plongeur d'élite et protagoniste du jeu se lance dans un voyage périlleux pour arrêter et détruire la menace imminente. À bord de son navire il survole neuf zones infestées d'ennemis et plonge dans des cyber mondes abstraits et stimulants. En appuyant sur un bouton, il dispose de quatre armes différentes: un canon Vulcain , de larges faisceaux laser, des lasers à tête chercheuse étalés et un canon à foudre à courte portée. Chaque arme peut être allumée trois fois au total en collectant les "P"  qui apparaissent à l'écran, tandis que les "S"  augmentent la vitesse globale du navire. D'autres objets spéciaux sont disponibles tout au long du jeu, tels que des bombes intelligentes et des boucliers protecteurs.</synopsis>

The game does not let the player completely control Goku, instead choosing whether he is on the offense, defense, powering up, or running.

      <synopsis>Strawberry Fields - a magic country populated almost exclusively by beautiful young girls (that is, if we don't count the Wise Old Man and a couple of other male exceptions). All went well in this peaceful place, until the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country's lovely inhabitants and placed a curse upon them, turning them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might know as Desmond, the hero of Knights of Xentar), a young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the curse one has to find three sacred writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be very grateful!

Dragon Knight II is the predecessor to Knights of Xentar, the only Dragon Knight game that was ever translated into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. Takeru has to explore the three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various people.</synopsis>

The remake has the same story (the wandering knight Takeru has to defeat a demon who threatens a town populated only by women) and core gameplay (explore a huge dungeon full of monsters, return to the only town to buy better weapons and equipment), but features better graphics, more convenient battle interface, and voice acting.

Despite the abundance of pretty girls, there are no explicit sex scenes in this game.

As the name implies, the remake also has a "graffiti mode" (accessible from the main menu), which lets the player view all the hand-drawn pictures of the game - those of pretty girls or any other kind.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>This version of Dragon Knight III is based on the earlier computer release, known in the West as Knights of Xentar. While retaining the story, the graphical style, and the basic location layout of the computer version, this release has substantial gameplay differences.

Unlike in the computer version, the battles are not real-time, but turn-based, and utilize a different perspective; randomly encountered enemies are fought in a first-person, Dragon Quest-like traditional Japanese RPG style. Enemy design is also quite different; many of the monsters from the original version have been replaced with female characters. The graphics in the top-down areas have been slightly enhanced.

This version also censors the adult content. The scenes are still suggestive, but there is no explicit nudity in them any more. Some of the cutscenes have been completely re-drawn, eliminating even implicit sexual activity.</synopsis>

      <title>Dynasty Wars</title>
      <synopsis>Originating in the arcades, Dynasty Wars is a beat-em-up set during the Three Kingdoms Era of the Chinese history, and is, more specifically, based on the Tenchi o Kurau manga adaptation of the story. The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers. 

Four historical characters from the time period can be controlled: Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao), and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are distinguished by their health and strength parameters.

The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called "tactics" can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist's HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes.

Stages typically culminate in boss battles. Along the way, various power-ups can be collected. Besides treasure that increases the player's score, and food packs that heal the protagonist, there are also yellow and blue orbs, which represent the game's light RPG elements: yellow orbs count as experience points and increase the character's vitality after a stage is over, and blue orbs increase the power of his weapon.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Eiyū Sangokushi is a somewhat light-hearted depiction of the famous Three Kingdoms historical period in China. In its core, it is a turn-based strategy game, similar to the more popular Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. The player has the choice of playing through 8 different scenarios, starting with Dong Zhuo's rise to power in the late 2nd century, and ending with the last struggle of Cao Cao's sons and the destruction of the three kingdoms. The player can also construct his/her own map, and play it controlling any of the available Three Kingdoms characters from any scenario.

The player selects a warlord and his capital city, from which he manages his wars. Compared to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the game is quite simple, with the battles being automatic and the player having by far less strategic options, focusing mostly on comparing statistics and building a line of generals powerful enough to attack the nearest city. Unlike most other historical games, the game has a comical, "super-deformed" graphical style, with famous Chinese warlords presented as typically Japanese big-eyed anime portraits.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In Emerald Dragon the player takes control of Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse... The game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a "world map": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Project F is a managerial simulation that puts the player in the role of the owner of a Formula 1 company. The player is responsible for paying salary to managers, mechanics, and other members of the staff; it is possible to raise or lower the salary, which may lead to various consequences depending on the employee's personality. Then the player makes contract with one or more drivers, selecting them from a list. Car customization plays an important role. Gasoline, engines, chassis, wheels, tires, brakes, and other components must be purchased from manufacturers of the player's choice.

The racing competition itself is non-interactive. Tournament events follow depending on its schedule, and the player simply watches how the race unfolds and ends according to the participants' parameters. Brand and player names in the game resemble real ones, but have been slightly altered for copyright reasons.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Feed Sluster is a fiend hunter: a man who takes job that involves elimination of mysterious beings known as fiends. One day he is contacted by a woman named Beth, who offers him a more demanding job, which involves investigating shady activities between humans and fiends, and getting to the bottom of the entire mystery, discovering the origin of the fiends and determine their ultimate fate.

Fiend Hunter is a cinematic platformer set in an Old West-like environment with supernatural elements. With the exception of the initial town and a few other locations, the game is spent in areas that require carefully navigating Feed through a series of platform-like structures. Controls and animation resemble those of Prince of Persia. Feed can jump, run, perform a running jump, hang on ledges, pull up or drop down, kneel and crawl. He also takes falling damage; the primary challenge during platforming sequences consists of preventing him from falling down.

Enemies only appear at pre-set points; each battle is one-on-one, and it is impossible to escape from a fight. Coupled with the enemies' high HP count and varied attack patterns, this essentially turns each encounter into a boss battle. Feed fights with a sword and can perform various moves, combining attacks with jumping and ducking. He can also gain access to a few magic spells.

A little fire fiend named Exy accompanies Feed on his journey. Exy can be used as offensive and defensive enhancement in combat, and can also be set to light dark areas. Each enemy drops a special orb that can be used to increase Feed's vitality, attack power, or magic, as well as teach Exy more powerful attacks, which gives the game a light RPG flavor. Feed can also equip rings and buy or find health-restoring and protective potions.</synopsis>

You control the police craft 'Hunting Dog' and have a selection of weapons at your disposal, each of which can be powered up. There is the standard forward firing lightning laser, a wide but less powerful shot and a 3-way bomb weapon that deals the most damage. Also available to you (thanks to the ever helpful Esty who flies by and drops things off from time to time) is a shield and gun pods that follow you above and below, and can switch direction with a quick double tap on the fire button.

      <synopsis>Life became more and more complicated in the 22th century. Humans have constructed a super-computer known as MESIA, entrusting it with the task of monitoring everything that happens on the planet. However, the computer grew increasingly megalomaniac, and eventually decided to conquer the Earth with deadly machines of its own production. In the middle of the 23rd century, humanity engages in a decisive battle against MESIA. Their hopes lie with Ken Ryugasaki, who pilots the powerful mecha Tracer on his journey to the super-computer's lair.

Genocide is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls Tracer, who can fight with a sword-like melee weapon and jump. Later in the game Tracer acquires "Betty", a powerful weapon that can shoot in eight directions. The gameplay is fairly straightforward; there are no power-ups, and the bulk of the game consists of surviving continuous onslaughts of enemies.</synopsis>

      <title>Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Yuna 2 - Eien No Princess</title>
      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>This is the second game in the series about the school girl Yuna Kagurazaka, who fights crime in cosmic battles. Eien no Princess continues the story of the first game. Yuna has defeated the 13 Servants of Darkness, and their leader Lia has become a friend, fighting crime on her own in a superhero TV show. Life seems to continue normally, the only trouble being Erika, a snotty high school girl who sees herself as Yuna's biggest rival. She challenges Yuna to a fight, but both are spotted by the titular starship "Eternal Princess", commanded by the pretty Princess Mirage, whose task is to stop violence in the whole galaxy. What begins as a misunderstanding ends as a serious threat to the Earth...

Eien no Princess is what is usually called a "visual novel". Most of the game consists of the player being taken to different locations automatically, where he watches the story unfold, accompanied by text and voice acting. Sometimes there is a menu verb to click on (such as "Look at..."), which doesn't mean much since the menu offers no choices. There are, however, a few turn-based battles in the game, with different attacks to choose, such as attack, defense, special, etc.</synopsis>

There is no in-game background story or plot-advancing cutscenes, with the exception of a wise old man who would sometimes offer the cat-suit-clad hero some help.

      <title>Godzilla</title>
      <synopsis>This interpretation of the famous giant monster from the Japanese cinematic industry takes form of a fighting game, only instead of the usual brave martial artists the players control horrifying monsters from the traditional  Toho lineage: the titular beast itself, Rodan, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and others. The game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed the Normal mode.

The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.

The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal "punch-kick" scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood.</synopsis>

This is a horizontal fighting game, where you basically take one of the three characters (the barbarian Ax Battler, a dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead or the amazon Tyris Flare) and bash everything which stands between you and Death Adder himself. Each character has a special magical ability that can be charged by kicking small blue creatures that drop a potion. There is also a green variety off this creature that drops food that replenishes your health. Some enemies ride dragons and a scorpion like creature. The enemies can be knocked off and you can mount the creature yourself and attack the enemies with it.</synopsis>

There is no background story information in the game besides the notion of TDF2, an organization consisting of aircraft and mechas, fighting an alien race known as Plea. The gameplay is quite simple: the player is presented with a fairly small isometric screen and must navigate a handful of fighters on it, attacking an alien when he is on the adjacent square. Player-controlled mechas and vehicles come in different types: some are strong but have limited manoeuvrability, others have a wide movement range but weak armor, etc. Battles are shown on a separate screen and proceed automatically, both sides exchanging an attack.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Tekipaki: Working Love is a simulation game somewhat similar to Graduation series, but with a much less complex system and "working girls" instead of students. The game's graphics were drawn by the manga artist Izumi Takemoto. The setting is 23rd century, and the player has to take care of three girls from different planets: Naomi, Hikaru, and Edalt. The goal is to make the girls successfully perform their working duties (mostly secretary-like assignments), at the same time having free time to rest. With each activity, certain parameters (stamina, intelligence, etc.) of the girl will increase and decrease. Since the three girls have different parameters from the beginning, it is important to understand their personalities and to find the right balance between work and leisure. The girls also have a "loyalty" parameter, that usually increases when the player lets them have a day off.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>An ordinary Japanese student finds a floppy disk on the street; using his computer to load data from it, he miraculously summons Foltjunia, an intergalactic warrior who fights evil in her robotic armor with three companions. However, Foltjunia has lost her powers and as a result stays with the hero, giving him advice as to how to conquer the love of a schoolmate.

Following a brief prologue with adventure-like gameplay, the bulk of Hatsukoi Monogatari consists of managerial simulation along the lines of Princess Maker games, though with more limited options and no RPG elements. The player manages the hero's daily schedule, divided into two segments: school and home. Activities include studying, having conversations with students or teachers, taking part-time jobs, resting, talking on the phone, shopping, buying presents, etc. Each activity increases or decreases some of the hero's parameters. The overall level can be evaluated on a special screen, and the goal is to raise it by balancing the stats with various activities.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Hawk F-123 is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. There is no background story in the game and no cutscenes; the player pilots a fighter plane, flying over various areas such as a desert, a sea, a city at night, etc. Most of the enemies are different types of aircraft, though a few stationary turrets appear as well.

The player-controlled fighter can pick up power-ups that change his primary weapon: red for a vulcan gun, yellow for energy bolts, and blue for laser. Each of these will increase in power (e.g. three lasers instead of one for the blue weapon) when the player repeatedly collects power-ups of the same color. Other power-ups add a secondary weapon or enhancement to any of the described above, such as homing missiles, fireballs, a wingman, etc. Secondary weapons are fired simultaneously with the main ones. In addition, special weapons can be collected and accumulated. These weapons are triggered by pressing a separate button, and include delayed bombs, exploding bullets, protective shields, and others.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>High Grenadier is a turn-based strategy game with role-playing elements. The game has a rather abstract plot that depicts a battle between two human organizations, each piloting and commanding giant mechs; no further details are revealed in the game. The gameplay takes place on a battlefield composed out of dots connected by lines; both player-controlled and opponent's army can move only between adjacent dots.

The player has six commanders at his disposal; each of them can lead a several various mechas into the battle. Three commanders are available initially, while others can be called into battle later. Once a player-controlled and an enemy unit meet on the same dot, the player can order the commander to attack, defend, or retreat. The battle then proceeds automatically, its result calculated by the statistics of both units. The role-playing element involves leveling up mecha parts; a number of experience points is awarded after a battle, and the player can freely distribute them to raise the mecha's parameters.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A high-school student named Kōsuke had a dream, in which he saw a beautiful woman talking to him. The next morning he found out that the new teacher looked very similar to the woman he saw. After overhearing a conversation, Kōsuke realizes that the new teacher is in fact a detective sent to investigate the murder of a female student that occurred in the gym. The young man has to play his cards right in order to become part of the investigation, solve the mystery, and perhaps impress the attractive teacher in other ways.

Himitsu no Hanazono is essentially a visual novel. There are no verb commands and no real interaction with the environment. The choices are rather frequent and fairly numerous (usually four or five choices at most screens). Most of these choices, however, do not affect the plot, though they may alter subsequent dialogue. The player is also able to navigate the protagonist on school grounds and inside the main building in a top-down fashion, visiting locations in any order.</synopsis>

      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>Hokutosei no Onna (the title refers to the express train connecting Tokyo and Hokkaido in Japan rather than the Ursa Major constellation) is based on the works of the Japanese detective story writer Kyōtarō Nishimura, starring Inspector Totsugawa and his assistant Kamei, who is the protagonist of the game. A man was found stabbed to death in his apartment in Tokyo; shortly after the investigation begins, another man is killed in a hotel room in Hokkaido. Kamei must question witnesses and suspects and examine evidence in order to solve the mystery.

The gameplay format is that of a Japanese adventure: the player selects verb commands (Examine, Ask, Move, Show, etc.) and combines them with people or objects to gather information and advance the plot. At certain points the interaction switches to point-and-click interface, requiring the player to carefully examine a room or an object, searching for clues.</synopsis>

      <title>Horror Story</title>
      <synopsis>Originating on the arcades (where it was known as Demon's World to the Western audience), Horror Story is an "old-style" side-scrolling platformer/shooter. The basic gameplay premise is very simple: shoot and jump your way through large amounts of monsters, defeat the boss, proceed to the next level. There is no narrative of any kind in the game, and no cut scenes; the hero is a tough-looking Duke Nukem-look-alike equipped with guns. 

The screen is scrolling at all times, even if the player character doesn't move. The levels are almost entirely linear, the only choice sometimes being to stay on the ground or jump to the higher platforms. Cooperative two-player mode is available.

Though shooting is decidedly the main gameplay element here, jumping (particularly double-jumping) must be used liberally to navigate the hero through platform-based stages, and avoid and kill enemies (since jumping on their heads eliminates them as well). Weapons can be switched by catching power-ups, which appear as floating, constantly changing letters. Depending on the letter the player decides to take, the hero will get different weapons. These weapons include: a steady energy beam of moderate power; flamethrower; bombs; a short-distance grenade launcher of sorts; and a gun that spits fireballs in three different directions.

As the name implies, the game has a horror theme. The game begins in what looks like old Japan, complete with traditional Japanese demons, but later switches to more "mainstream" horror, complete with haunted towns, ghosts, zombies, skeletons, etc.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Human Sports Festival is a compilation that contains three previously unreleased sports games:

Fine Shot Golf is a golf game for up to four players with an exhibition, tournament, and practice mode. It is possible to choose club types and (in the practice mode) golf course. The game is played from a first-person perspective, and requires the player to stop a moving bar at the correct moment to regulate the strength of the short.

Formation Soccer: Human Cup '92 is a top-down soccer (football) game that allows the player to choose an international team out of several available European and American ones. Formation and goaltender behavior can be customized; however, no detailed player management is present. The championship mode allows one or two players to compete against the computer.

Final Match Tennis Ladies is similar in style to Final Match Tennis, but with notable female tennis players (their names are slightly altered). It is possible to choose one of the three available tennis court types, as well as go through the Australian Open tournament controlling one competitor in a cup system.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Its sub-title translated as True Scary Stories, Hyaku Monogatari is a video game homage to the parlour game Hyaku Monogatari Kaidankai, which was popular during the Edo period (17th - middle of 19th century) in Japan. The game involved gathering at night, lighting a hundred candles and telling horror stories, extinguishing the candles one by one until the room became completely dark.

The game contains a hundred horror stories told in a linear fashion through text, digitized photos and sound effects. Most of the stories are very short and non-interactive. The exceptions usually involve visual novel-like choices of locations or responses to situations, which sometimes affect the story's conclusion. A recurrent episode involves visiting various locations in Tokyo area and reviewing criminal cases and ghost stories.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>After humans ventured into outer space, they began building colonies there. It became increasingly hard to maintain them, and special robots known as "Bidroids" were invented to do the hard work. However, the colonies began waging war on each other, and Bidroids were used for military purposes. When peace was finally achieved, the leaders decided that Bidroids could continue functioning as combat machines, but in friendly championships rather than in deadly wars.

Hyper Wars is primarily a managerial simulation; robot combat itself is calculated depending on how the player created and maintained his or her robots. The player controls a manager of a team which competes in a league, complete with schedules, stadiums, etc. The player is given an initial budget with which he or she is able to create the first robot models and train them. Each robot can be created by merging together various parts ("human", "beast", "bird", and so on). After creation, it is necessary to outfit the robot with weapons and upgrade its parameters by paying for training. When the player feels ready, the robots can be taken to combat arenas and participate in the tournament.</synopsis>

But use those wisely as they are only available in a limited quantities. As expected in this sort of game, a boss awaits for you at the end of each stage and unlocks new powers and weapons when defeated.</synopsis>

On July 18, 2048. Mariko, the mother computer on the moon base, gave a silent cry and went silent. Peace was then restored to the Earth and people tried hard on reconstruction on the devasted planet. Three years after, a Space probe placed between Saturn and Uranus detected the change in Deep Space for the first time. In the direction of Sagitarius, a cluster of objects emerged, warping the space around it and emiting light shifting to blue intro the spectrum.
The analysis of the spectrum revealed the most fearful data about the unidentified objects. Distance: 0.15 Years Light, Direction: Straight forward to the Earth, Conclusion: An Enemy Armada approaching. It now came home to the human race that the last space war had been nothing more than a preliminary skirmish.</synopsis>

All the blocks have the same shape and are only distinguished by their color. The player must selects groups of three or more identically colored blocks in order to make them disappear. The goal is to not let the blocks stack up and pass the upper border of the screen. Bombs would sometimes appear and clear out adjacent blocks if the player selects them.

      <synopsis>IQ Panic is a quiz game with a background story. A demon has kidnapped a girl from a peaceful village, and the elders send a boy named Gengorō to bring her back, defeating the demon's minions using his intelligence and knowledge. The game has a pseudo-RPG structure, with top-down navigation, overworld, towns, dungeons, treasure chests, random and boss "battles", etc. However, real RPG elements are very light in the game: there is no leveling up, and the protagonist's health increases automatically following a plot-dictated boss encounter.

The core of the gameplay are the trivia "battles" against randomly appearing characters. Each "enemy" will ask the hero one question in a variety of topics (English language, geography, popular culture, etc.). Answering the question correctly within the time limit will "kill" the enemy, while giving a wrong answer will reduce the hero's HP by one point. Boss enemies offer a choice of topics and take several correct answers to defeat. A few items can be used to restore HP, reduce the time limit, return to a town, etc.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A daughter of the chair of a local high school, Yū Honjō, has been kidnapped by someone unknown. Unable to go to the police, the girl's sister, Mai, hires a private investigator to find out what happened to her. The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Yū's disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.

Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Uchū Tantei Divan is a follow-up to Jantei Monogatari, though it can be hardly considered a true sequel because of its entirely new setting and themes. Set in a sci-fi environment, the game casts the player in the role of Divan, a young man who possesses the ability to transform into a powerful supernatural being, and is entrusted by military authorities to protect Earth against an alien demonic attack. This can be done only by defeating the evil minions in mahjong games.

Though featuring elements of a Japanese-style adventure game (verb commands that must be selected from a menu to trigger the next scene), the game focuses on mahjong matches against opponents, which occur as dictated by the plot. The game uses standard mahjong rules, with the exception of bonus powers that can be acquired for points distributed after each round and used in subsequent matches.</synopsis>

      <genre>Mahjong</genre>
      <synopsis>The events of Saver Angels take place after those described in the previous installment of the series, when peace on Earth has already been restored thanks to the efforts of Divan and Marie. Three cosmic spirits have lost their way in space and have to descend onto Earth, taking corporeal form. They enter the bodies of three young women who died recently: one in a traffic accident, another from disease, and the third one - a ten-year-old girl - after committing suicide. All three were avid mahjong players, and all three are now revived and endowed with mysterious mahjong powers. A special Mahjong Academy opens, and the Saver Angels (as the group begins calling itself) is ready to defeat any aliens and demons in that ancient Chinese game.

Saver Angels restores adventure elements that were absent from the previous game, and even enhances them. The player is now able to move in first-person perspective by pointing and clicking on a spot on the screen. Exploring locations, the player triggers scenes, which in turn lead to mahjong games. A special "mahjong mode" allows the player to choose an opponent from the story mode and challenge her (or him) to a mahjong match right away.</synopsis>

      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>The protagonist of the game was watching a performance by the Japanese singer Noriko Sakai (NORI-P) on TV. Suddenly, the singer was caught in a whirlwind and disappeared. The hero bravely followed her into a magical alternate dimension, but ended up in a forest, unable to find her. He must now find NORI-P and defeat an evil magician in the process.

Kagami no Kuni no Legend is a Japanese-style first-person adventure game. The player interacts with the game world by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects or characters. Commands such as "Examine" or "Talk" appear at most screens; if an object can be taken, an appropriate command is displayed after the player has thoroughly examined a location. There is also an inventory with items that must be used at specific moments; however, there are no real puzzles in the game. Navigation is done by selecting the "Move" command; in a few locations the player navigates the hero with directional buttons in a pseudo-3D environment. Wrong choices may sometimes lead to a Game Over.

Most of the background and character graphics is done in anime style, with the exception of Noriko herself, who appears in digital photos, sometimes accompanied by song performances.</synopsis>

      <genre>Fighter</genre>
      <synopsis>Kakutō Haō Densetsu Algunos is a fighting game. It doesn't have a developed story; rather, it tells background stories of the ten fighters the player can control in the game: Jenius, Asasin, Arcer (sic to all three), Samohan, Greeze, Orga, Lobo, Blocken, Jyobei and Daibuster. The only time the background story is told is when the player selects a fighter in the story mode. Usually, the five "good" fighters have to face the five "evil" ones one after the other (each in different order) if selected in the story mode. Though the game's intro states that it is less about who is good and who is evil, and more about who is the better fighter...

The gameplay is for the most part traditional fighting game-style (with the obligatory two-player battle mode as an option to the linear story mode); an important difference is the fact that some of the characters use swords and other weapons, rather than fight with their bare hands. The traditional "kick" and "punch" buttons are called "short attack" and "long attack" here; their execution is unique to each fighter.</synopsis>

      <genre>Role-Playing,Sports</genre>
      <synopsis>This installment in the fishing simulation series, of which the few localized games are known under the River King brand, is a hybrid between two different genres: the trademark fishing and traditional Japanese-style RPG.

The simple story involves, as in many other River King games, a hero and his sister; this time, the sister was about to catch a fish that was essential for their village's prosperity, but hasn't returned. The quest for bigger fish is therefore combined with the quest for the lost sister, and the hero equips weapons and rods to aid him in both tasks...

The RPG part of the game is old-fashioned for the most part, with "world map" navigation, dungeons, towns represented as icons, simple leveling up, etc. Random enemies (mostly animals) pop out on the world map and in dungeons; the battles are presented as simple enemy portraits, without a separate battle screen.

A stand-out feature of the battles is the ability to move around a small dot and aim at the enemies' body parts; depending on where it is aimed, different amounts of damage will be inflicted. It is also possible to miss completely, with the dot wandering outside of the enemy picture.

The fishing simulation part is integrated into the RPG gameplay: in towns, the player can buy fishing accessories (rods, nets, bait, etc.); on the world map, the player can navigate the character onto a river bank and start fishing using available accessories. Fish can be collected, sold, and used for a variety of purposes. A list of available fish with pictures can be viewed directly from the main menu.</synopsis>

      <title>Kaze Kiri - Ninja Action</title>
      <synopsis>Princess Shizuhime has been kidnapped by a group of ninja under the command of Genbu, and brought to the castle of the malevolent Lord Hiei. The brave young ninja Kaze is summoned by Lord Yoshikage and sent on a dangerous mission: infiltrate Hiei's castle, defeat his minions, and rescue Shizuhime.

Kaze Kiri is essentially a beat-em-up with a few distinguishing characteristics. The game consists of traversing fully linear side-scrolling areas, defeating regular enemies and bosses on the way. Before being able to fight the stage boss, Kaze has to vanquish a pre-determined number of enemies, which is displayed as a shared enemy HP on top of the screen.

Kaze attacks with his sword when he is near the enemy, or throws shurikens at them from afar. Enemy projectiles can also be blocked by countering them with shurikens. Kaze can also disappear for a moment and re-appear at another location. He can jump, duck, perform somersaults, and grab and throw enemies. Kaze's health regenerates over time if he is not hit repeatedly. Completing the game unlocks another playable character, the female ninja Suzu.</synopsis>

      <title>Kaze no Densetsu Xanadu </title>
      <genre>Action,RPG</genre>
      <synopsis>In Legend of Xanadu, the player controls a young adventurer named Areios. Monsters attack his homeland, and he is forced to flee. After traveling by ship and arriving at the town Bolda, Areios finds out that strange things have been happening in the North Cave near the town. His first mission will be to venture to the North Cave and investigate the matter. Of course, soon Areios finds himself involved in a battle against sinister forces, and commences the longest and most dangerous adventure of his life!

The game is an action RPG set in the Dragon Slayer universe, with a gameplay style similar to Falcom's other popular series, Ys. Controlling Areios, the player explores the top-down world, visiting towns and fighting monsters in vast outdoor areas and dungeons. Like in Ys series, it is sufficient to "bump" into a monster in order to inflict damage. Areios gains hit points and becomes stronger by sustaining damage from enemies and resting. His weapons and armor can gain experience and level up. In many areas, companions will join Areios and help him in combat, controlled by the computer AI.

The game is divided into chapters; the final stage of each chapter is a side-scrolling/platform level, which Areios has to navigate in order to reach the boss enemy, defeat him, and end the chapter. In such stages, the combat turns into a more familiar action-oriented style, with the player being required to press buttons in time in order to execute attacks and jump.

There is a day/night cycle in the game, manifested not only in graphical changes, but also in the schedules of townspeople: when it's dark, people will return to their homes and go to sleep, etc.</synopsis>

The game designs are really similar to early Sunrise animations or Toei classic japanese series like Mazinga Z and Grandizer. Your robot can use different sort of weaponery, from standard blue spreading bullets, to green laser waves and even a sort of 'yoyo' attack. Stages have a standard structure with quite big end of level bosses. Your main weapon can also be charged and trigger a powerful and destructive attack.

      <synopsis>Kisou Louga is an interesting mix of fantasy war game and role playing game. The game offers awesome full screen animations. The game starts as the two main characters (Buaisu and Gaimu ?) rescue a beautiful girl (Erena) being chased by dark and evil knights. She joins them and tells the story of an evil man and his army of knights. As any traditional strategy game, fights are round based and always start with a scrollable top view of the battle field. During each round, you can either move your characters or engage a close combat if you are close enough to your enemy. The view then zooms in and displays your opponents and yourself, and enclose any characters near to this area. The game is really varied and the Japanese language is only a limitation if you want to know more about the storyline.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Un démon maléfique a émergé des ruines d'un temple sacré. Une jeune femme nommée Erena est persécutée par l'Empire militant Hielun, qui poursuit son propre agenda et est convaincu qu'Erena a un lien mystérieux avec les pouvoirs du démon. Cependant, un chevalier nommé Vaice et ses amis sauvent Erena et se préparent à la défendre, s'impliquant peu à peu dans un conflit armé à grande échelle.

Kis? Louga est un jeu de stratégie au tour par tour. Le gameplay se compose entièrement de batailles, avec des cinématiques de style anime avançant l'histoire entre les missions. Le joueur navigue des caractères individuels dans des emplacements généraux. Un contact avec une unité ennemie initie une bataille séparée, où le joueur sélectionne les commandes (Attaque, Objet, Spécial, etc.) à partir d'un menu.

Les châteaux jouent un rôle important pendant les batailles: les personnages peuvent retraiter et soigner dans un château contrôlé par un joueur, et la conquête d'un château ennemi est souvent requise ainsi qu'une partie de l'objectif de la mission. Les châteaux peuvent être défendus par des arcs, des catapultes, etc., et leurs portes doivent être détruites en les attaquant. Les missions impliquent souvent des batailles entre plusieurs côtés. Malgré les menus de type RPG, les statistiques individuelles et la gestion de l'équipement, il n'y a pas de véritables éléments de jeu de rôle dans le jeu, puisque les personnages ne se lèvent pas ou ne se renforcent pas d'une autre manière.</synopsis>

      <title>Kuusou Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy</title>
      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>The game is based on the anime Gulliver Boy, created by Teruhisa Hiroi. Gulliver is a young boy who studies magic in a school in a small town in Italy, but is bored with the studies and craves adventure. After he gets his magical diploma, he goes to Venice to hook up with his best friends - the girl Misty, who has healing powers, and the genius inventor Edison. Together, they must stop the plot of the Spanish crown to dominate the world.

Kūsō Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy differs greatly from the Super Famicom interpretation of the anime. Unlike that action role-playing game, it is a traditional Japanese-style turn-based RPG. It utilizes traditional battle system with a four-heroes party, physical attacks and magic, etc. Stand-out features include a money system that is based on trading rather than obtaining gold from defeated foes, and the fact that the enemies are visible on the field and the combat initiates once Gulliver comes into contact with them, rather than appearing randomly.

Much of the exploration in the game is done by navigating a ship across the Mediterranean sea. Though story progression is linear, several areas of the game's fairly vast world can be explored in a non-linear fashion. The setting is loosely based on real world locations, with deliberately stereotypical, comical and anachronistic elements, involving science fiction and supernatural themes. The game features full-motion anime-style movies (instead of comic-book-like cutscenes typical for PC Engine CD games) and voice acting.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Sunny skies lend to the wonderful sense of freedom our two heroes experience as they break free of the bondage that is junior high. The final bell of the day brings limitless possibilities, homework a trifling matter when the weather is so beautiful and the trial that was the school day has been left conquered and forgotten. But youth goes hand in hand with recklessness, and in accordance with this proven rule, the newly freed students decide to shun the potential for constructive activity, instead opting to duck into a dreary alley and smear a complacent brick wall with all sorts of wacky illustrations.


And so they doodle away the late afternoon, taking pride in their ability to contribute to the neighborhood's desecration, until a scrawny sorcerer comes along and brings their creations to life, transforming the products of their imaginations into ruthless beasts of destruction. Of course, the evil sketch-animator abducts the female member of the duo as well. You know what comes next. One's woman must be rescued, and vengeance must be had.

What a way to spend a sunny day.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In a galaxy called Urora, two star systems were engaged in a prolonged war for domination: the federation of Soron and the Vado Empire. A peace treaty was signed between them; but the governments of either side knew that sooner or later there will be war again. The scientists of Soron developed a highly advanced technique, infusing human organism with powers of spirits. Five young ladies, under the command of Jennifer Sylkis, were imbued with this augmentation, which allowed them to pilot giant combat robots. Soon the fight for galactic supremacy will begin...

Lady Phantom is a turn-based strategy game. The game consists of linear missions, which take the player to large strategic battles; the goal is usually to eliminate all enemy units, though mission objectives such as reaching a certain area or preventing a certain key character from getting killed are also present. The player commands the five combatants, choosing their equipment before each battle. The battle screen is composed of hexagons; the characters have turns depending on their agility rating. When player-controlled or enemy character attack each other, an automatic battle sequence ensues.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Langrisser (ラングリッサー), known as Warsong in North America, is a tactical role-playing game developed by Nippon Computer Systems (NCS). The first in the Langrisser series, it blended tactical warfare with RPG elements, similar to the Fire Emblem series. It was initially released for the Mega Drive/Genesis console and the PC Engine (in Super CD-ROM² format), the former version being published by Treco in America. The PC-Engine version was released under the title, Langrisser: The Descendants of Light. It was later re-released along Der Langrisser (a remake of Langrisser II) in a compilation for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation. That compilation was released for the PlayStation Network in 2009.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The town Newcam, Massachusetts, 1924. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

Laplace no Ma (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to Sweet Home for NES. Unlike Sweet Home, this game is more oriented towards RPG gameplay. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</synopsis>

      <title>Last Armageddon</title>
      <genre>RPG</genre>
      <synopsis>The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.

Last Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.

Dungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.</synopsis>

      <title>Legend Of Xanadu - Kaze No Densetsu Xanadu 2</title>
      <genre>Action,RPG</genre>
      <synopsis>Legend of Xanadu II continues the story of the first game. Once again, the player controls the adventurer Areios, who emerged victorious after the final battle in the end of the first game. Together with his friend Daimos, Areios is looking for their other friend, who has disappeared. On the way, their ship is attacked by the evil Dragon Riders. It seems the search won't be as easy as they have thought, as Areios gets involved in a dangerous adventure again.

The sequel is very similar to the first game gameplay-wise. The player explores towns, vast outdoor areas, and dungeons, engaging enemies in real-time combat. Damage is inflicted upon the enemies simply by running into them, without any special attack button. There are various weapons to equip, and they level up in proficiency the more the player uses them. Areios gains additional hit points depending on the damage he receives. Party members help him in battles, controlled by the AI. The day and night cycle of the previous game has been removed.

Like in the previous game, there are side-scrolling segments which lead to boss battles at the end of each chapter. Compared to the first game, these stages are noticeably shorter, each containing only the boss fight itself, omitting platforming sections with regular enemies. Bosses must be fought using conventional action gameplay, attacking by pressing a button and jumping to avoid their attacks. It is also possible to defend actively and perform attacks in different directions. The player may opt to fight the bosses alone or select one of the available companions, either AI-controlled or in two-player mode.</synopsis>

In spite of the game's exclusively Japanese release, the protagonist delivers voiced monologues in English, musing over his mission, at the beginning of each stage.

The game has a traditional power-up system with a basic weapon power-up that changes its color rapidly when revealed (red for vulcan gun, green for lasers, blue for missiles), as well as assorted collectible letters that either enhance the strength of the gun with additional shots, add a secondary weapon (such as bombs), or provide the ship with a protective shield. In addition, a powerful all-screen attack can be executed by pressing the second action button. At several points during the game the player is able to choose the next stage among two available ones.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Lemmings is a puzzle-platformer video game originally developed by DMA Design and first published by Psygnosis for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC in 1991. The game was programmed by Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint.

The objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.

Lemmings was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second highest rated game in the history of Amstrad Action, and was considered the eighth greatest game of all time by Next Generation in 1996. Lemmings is also one of the most widely ported video games, and is estimated to have sold over 15 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several sequels, remakes and spin-offs, and has also inspired similar games.</synopsis>

      <genre>RPG</genre>
      <synopsis>An asteroid is nearing the planet Neo Kenya. Scientists warn that the planet might be completely annihilated by it. In a most unexpected turn of events, a deity known as Anubis spoke to people and asked them to save the planet's animals before the asteroids hit it. Anubis sent the humans a huge ship - a magnified version of Noah's Ark - and demanded that one man and one woman should dedicate their time to saving the animals. A whole special team has been assigned to the project. Ken is one of the youngest members of the team, and he is sent on the grand mission to save the animals, together with his childhood sweetheart, the lovely Linda.

This somewhat unusual premise translated itself into the gameplay mechanics. Though Linda³ is first and foremost a Japanese-style RPG - with top-down "world map", towns, turn-based combat, simple leveling up, focus on narrative and characters, and so on - it also has gameplay features rarely seen among games of its genre.

There are no random enemies in the game; they are visibly walking on the screen, and a contact with them triggers familiar turn-based battles (viewed from first-person perspective). Hostile animals should not be killed, but captured. They can be then used in towns for a variety of purposes, including weapon and armor enhancement, food, etc.

Animal saving is pivotal to the game's plot progression; in fact, at the very beginning of the game, the game offers three selectable difficulty levels, which are determined by the amount of animals Ken must save in order to complete the mission.

Beside hostile animals, there are also certain types of animals (such as dogs) that will join the party and fight alongside Ken and Linda.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Loom is based on a serious and complex fantasy story. With its experimental interface, it eschewed the traditional paradigm of graphical adventures, where puzzles usually involve interactions between the game character, the environment, and multiple items the character can take into their possession. Loom's gameplay centers instead around magical four-note tunes (drafts) that the protagonist, Bobbin Threadbare, can play on his distaff. Each draft is a spell that has an effect of a certain type, such as "Opening" or "Night Vision". Drafts can be learned by observing an object that possess the qualities of the relevant draft; for example, examining a blade while it is being sharpened gives the player the "Sharpening" draft.</synopsis>

      <title>Magicoal</title>
      <genre>Action,Role-Playing</genre>
      <synopsis>The boy Rhun and the girl Melvy live in a quiet forest village, both studying the art of magic. They enjoy a peaceful life, learning the secrets of the spirits and magical creatures populating the area. But on one fateful night, everything changes. A horde of goblins invades the village, burning it down. And it looks like the local church is in cohorts with a powerful demon bent on destruction! Before the heroes can realize what is happening, they are forced to escape into the forest, with only their magical powers at their side...

Magicoal is a "pseudo-RPG", i.e. an action-adventure with some minor RPG elements (money, items, etc.), but without an experience system of any kind. It can be played in two-player cooperative mode, controlling Rhun and Melvy, or as a single-player game, choosing one of them and letting the computer AI control the other. The player(s) can switch between the two at any time.

Most of the game is dedicated to exploring top-down areas populated by enemies, and dealing with them in action-based combat, primarily relying on magical spells. While some of the spells have unlimited use, others must be "refilled" with special items found or dropped by the enemies. Rhun and Melvy learn spells unique to each character, of various elemental affinities and general usage (offensive, support, etc.). Money can be collected from enemies as well and then used in shops to buy items.</synopsis>

      <genre>Board game</genre>
      <synopsis>In Mahjong on the Beach the player controls a young man in a large coastal city, who meets various scantily clad young women and plays mahjong with them. The player character can be navigated on a top-down map, accessing locations that lead to semi-random encounters with girls and subsequent mahjong games. Winning these games unlocks new locations and allows purchase of items that can be used during the encounters to the player's advantage. In the versus mode the player can directly compete against any of the girls; however, this mode contains only mahjong matches themselves, without any graphical indication as to which opponent the player character is facing.</synopsis>

      <genre>Strategy,Adult,</genre>
      <synopsis>In Mahjong Vanilla Syndrome, the player takes the role of a young man who finds a mysteriously-looking little house, opens the door - and falls through a portal into another dimension! There, he is greeted by a cute bunny-eared girl named Vanilla (perhaps it should have been Bunnyla, but we'll never know), who says she is the guardian of the portal, and if he wants to return home, he'll have to defeat her and the other guardians in the game of mahjong!

The game has two modes: story mode, which puts the player against Vanilla and advances the story after mahjong rounds; and battle mode, which allows the player to choose between three cute female opponents, and also change some of the game's rules.</synopsis>

      <title>Mamono Hunter Youko - Makai Kara No Tenkousei</title>
      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>Makai kara no Tenkōsei is based on the anime series Devil Hunter Yohko. The anime focuses on Yohko Mano, a Japanese high school student who discovers that she is the 108th Devil Hunter, destined to fight supernatural evil beings in accordance with her legacy. The game puts the player in the role of Shoma, a new exchange student who meets Yohko and her best friend Chikako at his new school. Miraculously, the three are teleported into a parallel dimension, and the reluctant hero discovers, to his amazement, that its inhabitants seem to be familiar with him.

The game plays like a typical Japanese-style adventure, with a menu of verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, and Move) at nearly every screen, some leading to object lists. It is often necessary to go through the commands several times to unlock a new one or trigger events. Limited menu-based navigation is also present.</synopsis>

      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>Tooki Yobigoe is a direct sequel to Mamono Hunter Yōko: Makai kara no Tenkōsei, continuing where the story of the previous game left off. Yohko, Shoma and Setsuna are attacked by demons on the flying ship, and have to use their recently found powers to fend them off. As opposed to the previous game, where Shoma was the protagonist, Yohko is the player character in the sequel.

Gameplay-wise, the puzzle-less Japanese adventure format is further utilized. Verb commands must be selected from a menu and sometimes combined with objects or character names for interaction. It is often necessary to repeat commands several times to trigger the next event.</synopsis>

The world can be navigated screen by screen, by clicking the mouse where you want to go. Many objects on each screen can be clicked to find hidden animations and sounds. Exploring the completely open world, you can listen to and have educational conversations with Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Dragon, and others.

The Manhole is aimed at children, and focuses on exploration and experimentation. There is no progress to be made, no goal to be reached, and the player can not fail. The entire world is accessible from the start.

The original Macintosh version consists of six black-and-white stacks for the Macintosh's HyperCard software. Ports to other systems added color graphics.</synopsis>

      <genre>RPG,</genre>
      <synopsis>In this game, the player controls a swordsman named Alan. One day he arrives at the village of Flodi, and finds out that his help is needed: the daughter of the village elder, Sophia, has been kidnapped by monsters and taken into the nearby cave. Naturally, rescuing Sophia is just the first quest among the many perils that await the hero on his journey...

La Valeur is a RPG that mostly follows the Japanese format: the hero wanders through the top-down locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, gaining money and experience, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion.

However, there are also some less traditional features in the game. There are three classes of weapons, distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies are strong/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them, and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.

The entire quest is played solo, without party members. There is no "world map", which is characteristic for other games of this kind. The gameplay is heavy on "level-grinding"; typically, a certain level must be reach in a given area before the hero is able to defeat the boss enemy. After having reached this level, regular enemies of that area stop giving experience points.</synopsis>

      <title>Master of Monsters</title>
      <genre>Strategy</genre>
      <synopsis>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen.

Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.</synopsis>

      <title>Mateki Densetsu Astralius</title>
      <genre>RPG</genre>
      <synopsis>It was just an ordinary cruise ship gig for the four musicians. The band leader, known only as the Flute (the player names him and the other heroes before the game begins), never thought that it will end in such a way... Suddenly, a tornado engulfed the ship, and the poor musician found himself in the magical world populated by angelic creatures and monsters! Naturally, this world, called Astralius by its inhabitants, needs salvation. Only the Magic Flute can avert a demonic threat. Apparently, our hero is the only flutist in all the dimensions, since it is now his task to take the unlikely role of a noble paladin, find other musicians to help him on his quest, and show everyone that music can, indeed, save the world!

Despite the somewhat unusual choice of protagonists, Mateki Densetsu Astralius is quite an "old-school" Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the nameless flutist and other musicians (trumpet player, drummer, etc.), who later join the party, exploring the top-down world, visiting towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, descending into dungeons, automatically leveling up, progressing the story in a linear fashion, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Casting magic spells is called "performing" in the game, though it requires magic points, like in other games of this kind. Those magic points must be bought in special shops.

Unlike most other PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD RPGs, there are no voice overs or animated cut scenes in this game.</synopsis>

The player controls a manager rather than a coach in this installment, and must keep an eye on the finances as a result. Also, instead of training all the five girls from the first game, the player's answers to the questions posed by the assistant in the beginning of the game determine the choice of the trainee among the same five characters.

The player must make schedules for the fighter, which include various training and recreational activities. The manager can hire coaches with their own programs, or input activities individually. The battles themselves allow little input, with the player being able to choose between various types of attacks by selecting them from a menu; the outcome of the battle largely depends on training and individual statistics</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Sci-fi shoot 'em up.
The following information was kindly provided by Brandon Sheffield of www.insertcredit.com: Metamor Jupiter represents the first (major, he had one previous collaboration) foray into games by musician/designer Masaya Matsuura, of Parappa the Rapper fame. Matsuura, hot off the disbanding of his pop group PSY'S, wrote a vocal song and some incidental music for the game. As for the game itself, it's a rather standard shooter, but is also notable as an early creation of Flight Plan, the developer that went on to create such notable titles as Summon Night, Black/Matrix, Poison Pink, et al. Definitely worth a go if you're a fan of either Matsuura or Flight Plan, and a decent enough, if merely workmanlike effort otherwise. Try it. 
I actually bought a copy of this game when last I was in Tokyo, and presented it to Matsuura at his office during an informal interview. He was incredibly surprised to see the game, as he'd lost the original copy of the track, and ripped the disc on the spot in order to get it back! Pretty nifty. Honestly though, I only played it for about 30 minutes. It's really quite ok, but is way more interesting for its history than anything else.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Meteor Blaster DX is a homebrew Asteroids variant. The player controls a spaceship navigated by an astronaut named Stryker, who is sent on a mission to destroy dangerous asteroids in space. There are four different ships to choose from, each with different power and speed ratings. The player can move the ship and rotate its cannon to shoot asteroids. Big and medium asteroids split in two when shot, and only when they are small they can be fully destroyed. A stage is completed when all the asteroids have been eliminated. All the stages take place on the same screen, but feature different enemies and difficulty level.

The DX version is a physical release of a previous download-only version, and includes hostile UFOs that shoot at the player-controlled ship, boss battles, CD audio soundtrack, and power-ups that temporarily grant shields and other bonuses.

Also included on the CD is a timed mode ("Caravan Mode") of Implode, as well as the puzzle game Loop, which was previously only released in emulator-only downloadable format and requires the player to rotate and construct loops out of pipe pieces that gradually fill up the screen, making them disappear.</synopsis>

      <title>Minesweeper</title>
      <synopsis>Minesweeper is a minesweeping game, just like the one included in every copy of Microsoft Windows since ancient times. On a grid, the player clicks in a cell and hopes that it is not occupied with a mine. If it isn't, that cell is filled with a number, which indicates how many mines there are in adjacent cells. Using logical thinking, looking at the relations between different number cells, the player can conclude which cells contain a mine and mark them as such. Once all cells are revealed, the player progresses to the next minefield.

Three main game modes are available, differentiated by the size of the minefield: 9x7, 12x12 and 18x14. Clearing a minefield takes the player to another one of the same size, but with more bombs to clear.

A second mode is a mission mode ("voyage mode" in the PC Engine version), where the player is presented with 10 minefields each in 7 locations around the world. The first ones are very small, only 4x4, growing larger and larger from then on. What is different about the mission mode is that a few cells in the minefield are revealed from the start, putting the player's ability of deduction at test. The editor mode allows players to construct a minefield of their own, by inputting parameters of size and amount of bombs.

The Game Boy version can also be played by two players via a link cable. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx CD) version contains an additional mode entitled "Cook's Quest", in which the player has to help a cook to escape from falling boulders in a cave, represented by mines on a familiar minesweeper field.</synopsis>

      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>Mitsubachi Gakuen is an adventure game in which the player takes the role of a teacher in the Mitsubachi Academy, entrusted with the task of helping its female students to reach stardom by monitoring their studies and activities. The game is divided into four seasons, each with a sub-plot of its own (e.g. preparing to a competition with another school and handling intrusive journalists and possible spies), and each dealing with a team of five different girls. The player can check the dossier of all the twenty students at any time and learn more about them. The game features digitized photos of real people instead of the more common anime-style character graphics.

Gameplay-wise, the game features a traditional menu containing verb commands for examining the environment, talking to characters, checking the inventory, moving to another location, etc.; most of these verbs lead to a list of possible objects to interact with. There are no puzzles, but a few instances require the player to make the right choices in order to continue the game; in other cases it is possible to slightly branch the plot by making a decision.</synopsis>

      <title>Moonlight Lady</title>
      <genre>Action,Role-Playing</genre>
      <synopsis>Hiwako, the daughter of a convenience store owner in a little Japanese town, is just an ordinary Japanese teenager - actually a bit of a spoiled brat. Or so she thought, until one day, a talking bird named Nike (like the Greek goddess of victory, not like the footwear brand) told her that she possessed unique powers that made her transform into the glorious lady warrior Artemis. No, Hiwako didn't stop being a spoiled brat; but as Artemis, it is now her duty to protect her home town from a demonic invasion, and she does not intend to give up.

Moonlight Lady can be called a "pseudo-RPG"; its top-down view and town exploration make it look like a representative of the Japanese branch of this genre, but in reality, it is an action game with light adventure elements and no true role-playing system.

Throughout most of the game, the player controls Artemis and two other heroines (Aquarius and Minerva). Attacking is performed by pressing a button for the lead character's attack, and another for a simultaneous attack by the two other girls. The player can switch the leader at any time. The girls can also charge their attacks to execute more powerful ones.

Regular enemies populate the dungeons, but there is no reward (in the role-playing sense of this word) in defeating them; in fact, the player can try to avoid them altogether and head straight to the boss battle.

A few items can be found and used throughout the game, but there is no real weapon and armor management, nor a financial system of any kind.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Motoroader MC is, like its predecessor, an overhead racing game with car combat. Gameplay mechanics, however, are different: players can only control regular-looking cars, which are presented as small sprites. Each car is equipped with two types of firearms, which can be used against opponents to win the race. Every course only occupies one screen, and the player has to complete laps faster than AI-controlled cars or race against time. Multiplayer (for two or four players) is also available.

Time attack mode allows the player to select any course from twenty-five available ones, thematically grouped in five categories: Circuit (resembling racing tracks), City (urban locations), Nature (field, beach, desert, etc.), Märchen (colorful fairy tale-like courses), and Special (unorthodox designs, e.g. a giant ape overlooking a road). Courses usually include various hazards that slow down or trap cars, as well as turbo fields that speed them up. Some courses also have entrances and exits, which teleport cars to another location on the screen.</synopsis>

So, the object of the game is basically to hatch the most eggs &amp; get the chicks to your home before anyone else...

      <synopsis>In a world where advanced technology and magic co-exist, the Magic Empire controls the vast arid wastelands and the dwellings of mythical creatures. A group of four treasure hunters come across an announcement promising a reward of one million credits to whoever would recover a mysterious purple stone with the engraving of the Empire's crest on it. The four find the artifact relatively quickly, but it is stolen from them by another group with an agenda of their own. Now the heroes must bring the stone back while dealing with the dangerous foes on their way.

Mystic Formula is a top-down shooter. The player navigates the protagonist through hostile environments, shooting at regular enemies and bosses, and avoiding their attacks. The player can choose to control any of the four treasure hunters: a balanced lead character armed with a laser pistol; an elf who shoots fireballs from her staff; an agile female thief; and a sturdy, slow, yet powerful robot. All the characters use ranged attacks that can be upgraded with power-ups. In addition, another type of a power-up brings forth one of the characters from the group to aid the player in combat, controlled by the AI. Two-player mode is available as well.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Another day at Nekketsu High, another gang tournament... but this time its different! A wealthy school principal has placed a challenge for all the school gangs to compete in a special obstacle course composed of 4 different challenges that you and your team must overcome. First in line is a race across the city streets (and rooftops), next is an obstacle course filled with dangerous hazards, then a jumping challenge in which you have to break a series of metal balls, and finally an all-out fighting tournament.

The game uses the same engine and basic gameplay mechanics featured in other Nekketsu High games, with the only change being the goals you must complete to clear each stage. Seeing as how the characters are gang members, fighting and beating your opponents can be a viable way of winning the challenges, so several weapons and power-ups can also be found in the courses</synopsis>

      <title>Nekketsu Legend - Baseballer</title>
      <genre>RPG,</genre>
      <synopsis>In a world where baseball plays a pivotal role in people's lives, teams compete against each for supremacy, using spiritual and magical moves, as well as robots. Recently, a powerful demon took control of the land, and some humans began using the art of baseball for evil purposes. The malevolent Dark Baseballer has been terrorizing innocents, and it is up to a group of young people to restore justice.

Nekketsu Legend Baseballer is a role-playing game dedicated to baseball. There is no actual baseball simulation in the game: much of it plays like a traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down overworld, town and dungeon explorations, party management, leveling up, equipment, items, etc. However, all the usual RPG paraphernalia is completely baseball-themed. Random turn-based battles occur less frequently than in other comparable games, but last a considerable amount of time due to their mechanics: each party member is in control of a group of "baseball robots", and defensive and offensive actions are named after real baseball moves.</synopsis>

The opening episode describes his encounter with a little star that fell on the Earth and injured itself. Afterwards, the player can explore the island by selecting locations on the map. Much of the story is advanced automatically, and the interaction is mostly restricted to choosing a location to visit, clicking on objects to trigger scenes, or selecting a "yes" or "no" response to a situation.</synopsis>

The story of Nobunaga takes place during the Japanese civil war of the 16th century. In a wartime strategy game, 15 different warlords are represented across several territories.

One to eight human players can play, controlling different leaders and factions. Gameplay is done in one of two scenarios; the beginning of the civil war in 1555 or Nobunaga surrounded by his enemies in 1571. Management of population, supplies and military are the gameplay and successful manipulation of these numbers in the right combination to attack and defend against hostile intentions is what will bring your forces to victory.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Pachio-kun: Maboroshi no Densetsu is a pachinko game starring the semi-anthropomorphic character Pachio-kun. The goal of the game is to win as many jewels as possible by collecting points in pachinko games. The player has a limited control over Pachio-kun in top-down casinos, where the game can be saved, points exchanged for jewels, and all the pachinko machines accessed. The machines are presented in first-person view and come in varied flavors and designs, with different backgrounds, themes, and contraptions. Playing the machines involves adjusting the strength of the shot and then pressing the action button to release the balls. The player can also opt to view each detail of the machine on a zoomed-in screen. The game comes with a special controller that resembles a real pachinko joystick.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Long time ago, an evil cosmic entity known as Geios was defeated and sealed for aeons. However, a malevolent alien race has found a way to harvest its power and is now preparing for its reincarnation. Pachinko Planet was attacked, and its king slain. Returning from an interstellar travel, Pachio-kun boards the spacecraft Sledgehammer and embarks on a journey to defeat evil and restore his homeland.

Pachio-kun: Warau Uchū is a pachinko game with a storyline and limited top-down exploration. In most areas, Pachio-kun has to complete one or more pachinko games in order to be able to leave the location and advance the plot. Pachinko machines come in different flavors and difficulty levels. The controls are fairly simple, requiring the player to adjust the strength of the shot; the shots themselves can be fired automatically. The game was shipped with a special controller similar to a real pachinko device.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Yū is a young apprentice magician who lives in the Fairy World. One day, a magical error occurs, and Yū finds herself on Earth. In order to return to her world, the little fairy must find three stones that must be inserted into her magical brooch. A young girl who finds the first stone becomes Yū's companion (and the game's protagonist), and together they must find and recover the other stones.

Pastel Lime is a Japanese-style adventure with simple gameplay. Only a few commands (sometimes just one) usually appear on the screen, and the player's input is mostly reduced to selecting these commands several times to trigger the next scene. Sub-menus (such as conversation topics) may appear as well. Game progression is strictly linear, and the player has no choice of selecting locations to travel to.</synopsis>

      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>Digital Comic Patlabor is based on the anime series Patlabor. In the near future, officers of Tokyo Metropolitan Police pilot giant robots called "Labors" to combat criminals. Like most installments of the anime and manga, the game focuses on characters from Special Vehicle Section 2, Division 2, and the playable character is Noa Izumi. More specifically, the game follows the so-called "TV timeline", involving the Labor Griffon.

The gameplay is that of a traditional Japanese-style adventure. Three commands — Look, Talk, and Move — appear on every screen. The player selects these commands (there are no sub-menus with objects) to move between locations, examine rooms, talk to characters, and ultimately advance the storyline. The game also contains a variety of features (robot database, interviews with voice actors, etc.) accessible from the main menu, as well as a rock-paper-scissors mini-game starring various Labors.</synopsis>

      <genre>Board game</genre>
      <synopsis>Police Connection is a board game with a twist: instead of simply reaching a goal or collecting money, players take the roles of police detective and investigate crimes. There are three cases in the game, all accessible from the main menu: two murders (the victims being young women), and one case of missing money. Up to four human- or AI-controlled characters are trying to solve these mysteries.

Players navigate the characters in a turn-based fashion on a board representing an urban environment. The amount of steps taken by each character is determined by a dice roll, but the board consists of many branching paths, and it's up to the players to choose the desired ones. Characters can question suspects, gather clues and collect information when they land on appropriate squares on the board. Special squares procure cards, which can be used for various purposes, e.g. examine a piece of evidence, take a taxi to another place in the city, etc.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Mail is a young, cute, enthusiastic female bounty-hunting elf. Unfortunately, every time a bounty is a near something goes wrong: the last case was particularly painful, involving Mail bravely cutting off the head of a famous criminal - only to realize that his body escaped without the head. Mail tried at least to sell the head in the nearest town, but discovered that the local tavern was full of these heads stored in a basket. But not all is lost: Mail reads a poster that promises a big reward for someone who catches an evil wizard who terrorizes the land. Sounds like just the job Mail was looking for!

This version of Popful Mail is quite different from later releases, even though it has the same story and basic gameplay. However, the layout of locations, regular enemies, bosses, concrete events - everything is entirely different. This version is less of a fast-paced platformer and is more focused on exploration, with more maze-like levels and back-tracking. As in the other versions, there are "friendly" areas where Mail can buy weapons, armor, and items. There is no "attack button": Mail attacks by simply running into enemies or jumping on them.</synopsis>

You are a noble warrior who has just saved your kingdom from an invasion by the terrible Demon Lord. The grateful king offers you to choose any reward you wish for your brave deed.

You are the one who has to build Maria's future. Of course, you can do it in many ways. You can strive to make a real princess out of her, teach her good manners, study arts, to make her a brave fighter like yourself, or just a lazy bimbo who cares for nothing. Her destiny is in your hands!</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A hero saved the human race from utter annihilation by the gods. This same hero then was charged by the heavens to take care of young seed dropped from there. This seed becomes his daughter, and her guardian will be watching her progress.

In Princess Maker 2 the player assumes the role of a father to the blessed daughter of the heavens. For the next eight years, the hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing.

It is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game.

Mini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat.

The game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people. There are 74 unique endings in the game.</synopsis>

The game begins where the girls are already united and are getting ready for the grand quest. Your party contains nine girls, each one with various statistics and magic spells. The large party is divided into three smaller ones, and you switch between them while participating in random battles and fighting bosses. The combat is turn-based, and is viewed from a top-down perspective, like the locations you visit. You travel on the overworld map, visit towns, and descend into dungeons. The three active girls in your party can also unite to perform combo attacks.</synopsis>

One of the female crew members unexpectedly faints and is taken by her friends into an abandoned mansion discovered nearby.

Mei Star, an investigator with the team, and her computerized holographic assistant Navi must solve the mystery before it becomes too late.

Reading the old man's mind, Furuyagi ventures into the realm of memories, where a woman's ghost is attempting to avenge her own murder.

Aya is the third installment of the Psychic Detective series. Like in the previous entries, it is a Japanese-style adventure game with first-person view and menu-based interaction and navigation.

There are no puzzles, but pieces of evidence can be collected, stored, and viewed as inventory items. The interaction with the game world is menu-based.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Psychic Storm is a vertical shooter up by Alpha system and published by Laser Soft/Telenet. Earth is under attack by a vicious race of insectoid-like aliens and the action begins in New Hong Kong City where most of the alien invasion seems to concentrate. Humanity's last hope lies with four courageous pilots and their space-fighters - Alex and his vulcan-gun laser, Charr and his Psyco Shell, Joe and his short-ranged but powerful Hell Flame and finally Nastasia and her Ion laser beams. Each ship can fire secondary weapons and also transform into a bio-mechanoid-beast ship with frightening powers. Alex's ship, for instance, can turn into a giant butterfly and shoot waves of fire from its large wings. Obviously, these forms only last for a short period of time but more energy can be collected along the way to extend their temporal power. Flashing enemies drop power-ups when destroyed which can either upgrade the primary weapon (blue orbs) or bring some life back (dual orbs). Pressing the two action buttons together also unleash a powerful bomb blast - they however take time to recharge and need to be used wisely. Finally, a two simultaneous player mode is available where players can combine their ships into a much stronger and powerful mutated form.</synopsis>

      <title>Quest Of Jongmaster - Janshin Densetsu</title>
      <genre>Mahjong,RPG</genre>
      <synopsis>Quest of Jongmaster is a mahjong game with role-playing elements. The "RPG mode" follows the story of an apprentice "mahjong warrior", a girl named Chi Fou, who is sent on a quest to defeat monsters that were unleashed on the world. This mode is structured like a traditional medieval top-down RPG, with town and dungeon exploration, NPC interaction, and other familiar elements. The protagonist can equip weapons and armor, cast magic, and purchase healing and status-recovering items. Experience points and money are awarded after each battle.

Random and boss battles in this mode are standard mahjong games, with the addition of special tiles that influence the game's result, e.g. increase the damage inflicted by the equipped weapon. The final damage is calculated after the mahjong game is over, and depends on the characters' levels, equipment, and the winning combination. For example, winning the game with a full mahjong would most likely result in a "critical hit". Boss enemies typically take two or more rounds of mahjong to defeat.

In addition, the game features a versus mode, which allows the player to compete in mahjong games against the opponents of the RPG mode, with weapons, equipment, and level parameters playing no role. These opponents appear as monsters at first, but are revealed to be pretty young women who remove parts of their clothes when losing a mahjong round; stripping down to underwear equals defeat. Despite this feature, there is no explicit nudity in the game.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Quiz Avenue is a trivia game with a "quest mode" in which the player controls a warrior who must save the princess Questine from the clutches of evil Shameless, the enemies of the Erudition kingdom. The player navigates the hero on small boards with branching paths; each point of interest represents a quiz "battle" against a monster, culminating in a "boss battle" on the final stage, where the player is able to select the topic of the questions (e.g. geography, movies, English language, etc.). 
Quiz encounters vary in length and amount of answers to choose from, but always have a time limit for each question. In addition, a separate "party mode" allows players to compete in trivia games, each consisting of three or five rounds.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Quiz Avenue II, like its predecessor, is a quiz game with a story-driven quest mode, which continues the plot of the first game. After the evil Shameless were vanquished, peace was restored in the kingdom of Erudition; however, soon demonic forces appeared on the horizon, and two young warriors, one boy and one girl, were sent by the queen to stop them.

The quiz rules in this installment are largely the same as in the previous entry, with three or four answers to choose for each question and a time limit. The board advancement, however, is determined by choosing cards with the amount of steps written on them rather than by dot-to-dot movement of the first game. New is the two-player mode for the quest, in which the second player controls the heroine, and the two are answering questions simultaneously. A few new features, such as the possibility to acquire various bonuses before a quiz encounter, have been added. The party mode is replaced by the so-called "F1 Grand Prix", which is a series of trivia questions where each round is presented as a Formula 1 race.</synopsis>

      <title>Quiz Avenue 3</title>
      <genre>RPG,Strategy,</genre>
      <synopsis>Quiz Avenue III offers, like its two predecessors, a quest mode and a versus mode - the latter consists in this installment of a series of trivia questions for up to eight players (controlling a variety of tough-looking fighters), with rounds disguised as fighting games, each wrong answer leading to a loss of hit points. The main difference between this entry and the previous ones lies in the quest mode and its RPG elements.

Like a full-fledged role-playing game, the quest mode has leveling up, free top-down navigation, overworld, towns, dungeons, monetary system, weapons, armor, items, and even companions who join the main heroine, a girl named Konoha, who was raised by an old fighter and has to use her special abilities to rid the land of monsters. Battles occur randomly; the player has the choice to try to escape before the battle begins. Each enemy asks a row of trivia questions; correct answers damage the enemy and eventually defeat him, while wrong answers deplete the HP of the controllable characters. Levels, weapons, armor and items contribute to the damage equation, raising or lowering the amount of questions needed to answer correctly in order to prevail.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Quiz Caravan: Cult Q is a trivia game with four modes. The main mode involves a quiz competition in which players can choose the topics of the questions, e.g. movies, video games, history, etc. Up to five players can participate in this mode or compete against the computer AI.

The "adventure mode" is a board game in which the player-controlled character's movement is determined by a dice roll. Normal fields lead to short quiz encounters; other fields may enhance the protagonist's hit points, and the final field on each stage is a more challenging "boss battle".

Time attack mode involves answering correctly as many questions as possible within the allotted time limit. Finally, versus mode has players competing against each other; every right answer advances the character on a board, while the opponent is pushed back. All modes feature characters from other games published by Hudson Soft, such as Bomberman or Tengai Makyō series.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Quiz de Gakuensai is a trivia game in which the player takes the role of a high school student. One day he is entrusted with an important task of watching over his relative, a little girl. However, as soon as his girlfriend appears, the hero neglects his duty and very soon finds out that the little girl has disappeared. He has to explore the school building and find her at all costs.

The player can choose the order in which the protagonist visits various classrooms in the school. In each room there is a young and attractive girl who asks the hero a series of timed trivia questions on different topics (predominantly popular culture). Both the protagonist and the girls have certain amounts of hit points; a correct answer diminishes the opponent's HP by one, while a wrong one depletes the protagonist's health by the same amount.</synopsis>

The first is essentially a single-player mode; the championship allows players to compete against each other, with topics randomly chosen; the cup works like any comparable sports event, including elimination rounds.</synopsis>

      <genre>Quiz</genre>
      <synopsis>Time Machie ni Onegai differs from its predecessor by having its own unique gameplay modes rather than strictly following a TV game show format. The Time Machine mode involves traveling to different time periods and answering trivia questions in order to trigger famous events (e.g. Moses creating a path through the Red Sea for the Jews, the belligerents of the Three Kingdoms era attacking each other, apple falling on Sir Isaac Newton's head, etc.). The questions themselves, however, have usually nothing to do with the historical event in question.

Another mode in the game is called "Megaten Quest"; however, it is not a Megami Tensei related quiz, but rather an imitation of a first-person dungeon crawler with randomly appearing enemies who ask the player a certain number of question on various themes. The third mode follows the same quiz format with correctly answered questions leading to puzzle solutions, and is essentially the multiplayer portion of the game. In all modes, time limit is imposed on the entire round rather than on separate questions.</synopsis>

      <title>Ranma 1/2</title>
      <genre>Action,Arcade,Fighting,</genre>
      <synopsis>Based on the popular manga/anime series of the same name, Ranma 1/2 follows the story of an aspiring martial artist who accidentally turns into a young woman by bathing in a cursed spring. He can revert to his natural form by touching hot water; however, contact with cold water will turn him into a girl again. Most of the original manga story is dedicated to semi-comical situations, based on the fact that Ranma is trying to conceal his predicament, which leads to misunderstandings, confusion, and romantic complications in his high school life.

This interpretation of the license follows a part of the initial manga story, starting with the curse and going through Ranma's first conflicts with schoolmates and rival martial artists. The game is mostly structured like a "beat-'em-up" side-scroller, though there are also several boss fights that are more reminiscent of a one-on-one fighting game. The Vs. mode allows the player to recreate these boss fights using different characters.

Ranma's curse becomes a gameplay feature in the game: cold and hot water turn Ranma into a girl and a boy, respectively. Female Ranma is quicker and can jump higher, but her attack and defense are lower. Anime-style cut scenes advance the story between the levels.</synopsis>

      <title>Ranma 1/2 : Toraware no Hanayome</title>
      <genre>Adventure,</genre>
      <synopsis>Based on the Ranma 1/2 manga and anime series, Toraware no Hanayome consists of several chapters, which are similar to episodes of a TV show: each one has its own story and theme, but all the chapters have recurrent characters from the Ranma 1/2 universe. As in the original manga and anime, the story focuses on the young martial artist and high school student Ranma, who was cursed after bathing in a sacred Chinese spring: contact with cold water turns him into a woman, while hot water restores him to his original masculine form. Most of the story in the game is dedicated to Ranma's relationships with his schoolmates and other characters, often involving comic and/or romantic situations, as well as Ranma's attempts to get rid of the curse: in the first chapter, he tries to win a contest that would allow him to travel to China and find a way to turn him into a man permanently.

Unlike most other Ranma 1/2 iterations, this game is a so-called "digital comic", which is the same as Japanese-style adventure. Controlling Ranma, the player interacts with the environment by selecting verb commands ("Look", "Talk", etc.) and objects from sub-menus. The navigation is also menu-based. Animated cut scenes appear frequently to advance the story.</synopsis>

      <title>Record Of Lodoss War</title>
      <synopsis>The game is based on the novel cycle Record of Lodoss War by Ryo Mizuno, and more closely on subsequent manga volumes and OVA series. Its story generally follows the one of the OVA, the main hero being Parn, a young man who grows up in a small village and later becomes one of the strongest warriors in the world, thanks to his father's mysterious heritage and his own courage. Like in the anime series, the game begins with a goblin attack and with Parn leaving his home village together with his best friend Etoh in search of adventure.

This version of Record of Lodoss War is a traditional Japanese RPG with top-down world map navigation and random battles. There is a strategic element in the battles, allowing the characters to freely move on the battle field. However, the battles can be set on auto, making them more fast-paced and similar to traditional Japanese RPG combat. The towns have menu-based first-person view navigation.</synopsis>

      <genre>RPG,</genre>
      <synopsis>Set in the Record of Lodoss War fantasy universe, created by the Japanese writer Ryo Mizuno, this game is based on the anime Chronicles of the Heroic Knight. The story focuses on a young man named Spark, who wants to become a knight of the country of Flaim. King Kashue needs Spark to prove himself worthy of this title, and tells him to gather a band of mercenaries and prepare to stop the dark wizard Wagnard's mysterious plans.

The gameplay is similar to the previous Record of Lodoss War game. Spark and his party roam the top-down world map, visiting towns, villages, and other locations on the way. Enemies appear randomly. The turn-based battles once again offer free movement on the screen, but as before, auto-battle feature can speed things up. Towns and other important locations are viewed as still screens from first-person perspective.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Renny Blaster is a beat-em-up in which the player can choose to control either the paranormal private investigator Fujiro Yarai, or a man with a mysterious past and supernatural abilities named Seishiro. The two characters have the same goal: prevent a secret organization of monsters and undead, run by a maniacal vampire, from taking control over Europe. The two characters begin with different initial stages, but continue on the same path afterwards. Seishiro is physically weaker and has a default ranged energy attack; Fujiro fights with regular punches and kicks. Both characters have access to unique elemental attacks that are activated by holding down a button. Most of the stages are straightforward side-scrolling action with boss battles at the end of each; a few areas contain light platforming elements.</synopsis>

      <title>Road Spirits</title>
      <synopsis>Road Spirits is an arcade-style racing game, similar to Rad Racer. The player controls a car from an "into the screen" 3rd person perspective, racing through the 17 pseudo-3D courses (named after various geographical locations, e.g. "West Coast" etc.). There are other cars on the road, which can slow down the player-controlled car by colliding with it, but the race is against time rather than against these cars. The player is given a time limit for each course, and an indicator shows how close the car is to the completion. Should the car run out of time, the race is lost, and the player has to replay it before tackling the next one.

The car can be controlled with two buttons only; collisions do not damage the car, but merely make it stop; though the player can change a car model and gear system, no realistic gear-based driving is used in the game. All this contribute to the overall arcade feeling of the races.</synopsis>

      <genre>RPG</genre>
      <synopsis>Long time ago, a thriving civilization blessed by the gods was ruined as a result of a perpetual war. Humanity has built a new civilization, which resembles a medieval world. The young swordsman Jan lives In the kingdom of Cordelia. One fine day he and Ortena, the daughter of the High Priest, go on a treasure hunt. When they return, they find the country overrun by monsters; Ortena's father is killed, and the princess of Cordelia has been kidnapped. The two team up with a legendary hero, in order to rescue those who can still be rescued, and fulfill the legacy of the gods...

Ruin: Kami no Isan is an action RPG. The player navigates Jan through top-down towns and hostile areas; the "world map" is not free-roaming, allowing only linear advancement from location to location. Hostile areas are populated by enemies who are visibly walking on screen.

Unlike most Japanese RPGs, there are no separate "battle screens" in the game; the monsters are fought on the same spot they are encountered on, like in action games. However, unlike most action RPGs, there is a party in Ruin. The player controls only Jan, while the other party members act according to AI routines: attacking, casting offensive and healing spells, etc.

The rest of the gameplay is traditional Japanese RPG style: acquiring better weapons and armor, automatic leveling up, linear story development, etc.</synopsis>

As they go deeper and deeper they will find clues as to who ordered the kidnapping, the Sakazaki family's relation to the mob, and a person from their past.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.

The arcade version doesn't allow you to play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Sangokushi: Eiketsu Tenka ni Nozomu is a turn-based historical strategy game set in the Three Kingdoms era of the Chinese history and similar in concept and gameplay to Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, albeit with somewhat simpler gameplay. There is no scenario selection, and the exact timeline is not specified, though the initial situation corresponds to the phase of the war when Liu Bei and Cao Cao were the principal opposing forces. Players can choose to control any of the six most renowned warlords of the time, Liu Bei being the "default" player character with his own extended introduction and personal motives reminiscent of Luo Guanzhong's novelization of the historical events.

Each warlord tries to gain dominance by building up diplomatic relationships and invading other provinces. It is possible to send offerings and diplomatic missions to other rulers, as well as manage army commanders, finances, and provision. Invasions take place on a tactical hexagonal grid, on which the player positions his forces and navigates them in turn-based fashion. When opponents meet on adjacent fields an automatic battle sequence ensues.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>On one fateful night, a purple meteor has fallen down from the skies. Harnessing its power, the Demon Folk grew stronger, and started attacking peace-loving tribes and their villages. One warrior of the bunny-eared Monbit tribe stood up against the demons. Riding a dragon, he entered the palace of the Demon King and shattered the magic amulet he was wearing. However, the warrior was gravely wounded himself. He entrusted the amulet with the tribe elder. Years have passed, and the demons are once again rearing their ugly heads. The young hero is the only one who can save the world - by using the magic amulet's power, and by befriending a dragon...

Seiryū Densetsu Monbit is a traditional fantasy-themed Japanese-style RPG, with the typical progression scheme: the player navigates the hero (and other characters who join the party later) on the top-down overworld map, enters towns, buys weapons and armor, and fights randomly appearing enemies in first-person perspective, turn-based combat. One stand-out gameplay feature is the dragon egg the hero carries from the beginning of the game. As time passes, a dragon will be born, and assist the hero in various ways. For example, even as an egg, the dragon can serve as a healing item that replenishes a small amount of hit points.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A mysterious young woman with a baby was attacked during the Holy Night. She managed to escape, but collapsed and died in front of the church in the city of Yalem. But the baby survived, grew up, and eventually became a hero on a quest to avenge his mother's murderers and save the world.

Seiya Monogatari: Anearth Fantasy Stories differs from most other role-playing games in several important aspects. The player creates the main character in a unique way: when the baby lies on the snow outside of the church, several people pass by. The player can choose to press the action button, making the baby cry and attracting the attention of these people. Depending on the timing of this "baby action", the hero will be adopted by different people, which make him belong to a different character class (fighter, thief, mage, or monk), and also lead to four entirely different prologues (once the hero turns fifteen, the four stories eventually merge into one).

Instead of random battles - or even regular battles with wandering enemies - the game has pre-set battles, which occur much less frequently than in traditional Japanese RPGs. Winning the battles depends less on leveling-up and more on the actual tactics used during the battle. There are no levels in the game; instead, the characters gain better statistics depending on their actions during battles (e.g., using magic will increase magic power, etc.). The battles are turn-based and are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective. The game focuses on exploration, having large and complex locations as well as plenty of items of different categories that can be found if the player explores the game world properly.</synopsis>

      <title>Sengoku Kantou Sangokushi</title>
      <genre>Strategy,</genre>
      <synopsis>Sengoku Kantō Sangokushi is a turn-based historical strategy game set during the Sengoku period of the Japanese history. The player can take control of one of the three prominent warlords of the era: Uesugi Kenshin, Hōjō Ujiyasu, or Takeda Shingen. Each warlord initially controls a province with several towns, and tries to win over territory by diplomatic or military means. Every turn the player has a limited amount of moves at his or her disposal; every general has his own options, though some (e.g. marriage) are restricted to the main warlord himself.

Each town has to survive and raise reputation by maintaining an army and keeping the population happy. This is achieved by trading (buying and selling rice), giving money to civilians or soldiers, developing the town, etc. Every general can also strike alliances with rulers of other provinces, sign agreements, and send spies.

When an area controlled by a general is invaded by the enemy, the game switches into a top-down turn-based tactical battle mode. The player positions and navigates soldiers, engaging in automatic battles when the opponents meet on adjacent squares. Castle invasion and defense can be carried out through various means: for example, it is possible to send an assassin to dispose of the enemy general, or assign archers to fend off the invaders from castle walls.</synopsis>

      <genre>Strategy,</genre>
      <synopsis>Sexy Idol Mahjong is, as its title implies, a mahjong game starring popular Japanese female singers and TV personalities. In the game's background plot, they are the so-called "demonic women", ruled by a nearly immortal queen residing in a castle. The player takes the role of a medieval knight who must defeat these women by playing mahjong against them. The player character automatically moves on an overhead map and plays mahjong rounds against the women in a linear fashion. Defeating these opponents may reward the player with their digitized photos, usually featuring scanty clothes and seductive poses.</synopsis>

      <genre>Strategy,</genre>
      <synopsis>Fashion Monogatari is, like its predecessor, a mahjong game featuring digitized photos of Japanese female "idols". Gameplay-wise, however, this installment is quite different: it is a board game in which the player navigates a character by throwing dice to determine the number of moves. Like in other games of this genre, some fields bestow benefits on the player (e.g. award him money or items, invite the player to participate in bonus games, etc.). Most fields, however, lead to mahjong rounds against digitized young women, which have to be won in order to advance. Photos of scantily clad women in seductive poses serve as a reward for victory. A four-player mahjong mode is also available.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Yakyūken no Uta is, like other games in the series, a mahjong game featuring digitized photos of Japanese actresses. There is no story in the game; players can simply choose to compete either in four- or two-player mahjong tournaments, selecting individual participants or teams from a list. The game also contains a third mode which has nothing to do with mahjong: players select actresses who then begin to dance; players have to press buttons at the right moment to execute dancing moves. Actresses appear topless in these dances.</synopsis>

The Dark Ones have infiltrated Krellion, enslaved the wizards, and it is up to you to?well you can guess the rest.You begin in the City of Treyhelm. This is your base of operations for advice, weapons, healing, upgrades and the only place you can save your game. At first you can only kick, but if you RPG a bit and earn the gold, you can buy an axe, mace or bow. Each of these can then be upgraded 3 times. Eventually you can also purchase 3 types of body armor.Delving deeper, each time you save a wizard, you gain the ability to change form (hence the name Shapeshifter) and unlock new areas. Aside from being human, you can change into a panther, a psionic shark, a mighty golem and a golden dragon. Each form uses collected gems to initiate, and then a timer counts how long you can sustain the form until more gems are used.An extremely unique idea that really works is the eclipse. There is a small screen at the top showing a lunar cycle. Each time the eclipse happens; lightning strikes and your health is regenerated. This is great if you're in a tight spot ? just hang out and wait for the moon to go ?round again.The map is sprawling for games on this system, 16 unique areas in all with 12 challenging bosses!</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A young man lives together with his mother in Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he has a strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool.

"Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. Unable to understand what that means, the young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. As the young man acquires a device that allows him to communicate with demons, he begins to realize that his role in the upcoming events may be greater than he thought.

A follow-up to the first two Megami Tensei games, Shin Megami Tensei is a first-person RPG set in modern-day and post-apocalyptic Tokyo. The hero of the game can summon demons, who consume a mysterious energy called Magnetite, which can be obtained from battles. The summoned demon joins the party and is then fully controllable by the player. The active party can include up to six characters: the hero, the heroine, and four slots usually reserved for the demons, though other human characters might also join. There is a wide variety of demons in the game, most of which are taken from real-world mythologies. The demons have levels, individual statistics, spells, special abilities, etc.

Enemy encounters are random, and the first-person combat is turn-based. During combat, human characters can use swords or guns; the heroine is also able to learn and cast magic spells. Unlike most other Japanese RPGs, the game allows the player to raise the parameters of the two main characters manually when leveling up. A major gameplay element are demon conversations, which is usually the only way to recruit demons. Typically, the player has to convince the demon to join the party by choosing appropriate dialogue lines.

All the creatures in the world of Shin Megami Tensei belong to one of the three ideologies: Law, Chaos, or Neutral. The narrative is largely dedicated to conflicts between these ideologies; during several key moments in the story, the player has to decide which one to follow. Joining one of the ideologies influences the subsequent narrative as well as some gameplay elements: certain weapons can be only equipped by a follower of a specific ideology, demons are more likely to join the hero if he shares their ideology, etc.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>While flying your spaceship, you crash land on a planet covered entirely in slime. You and a friend explore the labyrinthine planet of slime, armed with a water pistol and all manner of gadgets you find along the way in an effort to find your way back out. The game world is a giant maze with quirky hidden areas and plenty of original layout ideas. Depending on the game mode, you are either cooperating or competing with your "friend" to find and get to an exit first. Due to the massive sizes of the slime worlds (about 6 entries to choose from), games often take several hours to complete.

The basis of the game is exploration, with varying game modes further focusing on competition, puzzle solving, speed, exploration, or cooperation.</synopsis>

      <title>Snatcher Cd-romantic</title>
      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>Snatcher is set in the futuristic Neo Kobe City, a city of madness and decadence. The year is 2047 (or 2042, according to the original Japanese version). Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called "Snatchers" because they "snatch" their victims before they take their place.

A new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs (which is deciphered as "Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Rangers" in the English version). Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked — is it a person or a snatcher?

The player takes control of Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. The gameplay largely follows the structure of a Japanese-style adventure. The player uses a menu-driven interface to execute commands, which include moving between locations and interacting with the environment. Typically, every room contains objects that can be examined, leading to text descriptions and comments. Conversations occupy a large portion of the gameplay, with various topics available and a wealth of information about the game's world and characters. A few parts contain light puzzle-solving elements, though as a rule the game is almost completely devoid of puzzles.

During key moments of the narrative, the player will be prompted to participate in intense shooting sequences. The goal is usually to kill all the enemies that pop out on the screen before they are able to kill Gillian. Some of such sequences are timed, i.e. the player is required to quickly shoot before another events is triggered, leading to the protagonist's death.</synopsis>

      <genre>RPG</genre>
      <synopsis>The game is based on the anime movie of the same name. In 24th century, piracy is still an issue, but no more in seas and oceans, sailing ordinary ships - the pirates are in space! The most dangerous pirate crew is the one of Sol Bianca - April, Janny, May, June, and Feb. No, those are not names of months, but five beautiful ladies, who can handle some high-tech weaponry and who think only about treasure. But the five lovely pirates are not evil - whenever some tyrant threatens a planet, they are there to help.

The gameplay of Sol Bianca is that of a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the five girls as a party, each one having individual statistics. The party of heroines visits planets, travels on the world map, and engages randomly appearing enemies in first-person perspective, turn-based combat.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>As earthquakes occurred in the kingdom of Itchy, and demons began roaming freely through the wilderness, the king realized that an ancient prophecy is about to be fulfilled, and the entire world is in danger. The valiant swordsman Soleil lives in the capital city, and the king entrusts him with the task of protecting the two Moon goddesses, and retrieving the Sun Sword, which are necessarily to prevent a magician known as Silver to use the Gears of Fate for his evil purposes...

Sol Moonarge is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. As in most games of this genre, the player navigates the main hero and his companions on the top-down "world map", entering towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as hostile locations which are necessary to complete to advance the plot in a linear fashion. Enemy encounters are random; combat is turn-based and viewed from first-person perspective.

As in most Japanese RPGs, the characters level up automatically, after having accumulated a set amount of experience points; specific weapon and magic proficiencies, however, grow depending on the amount of times player-controlled characters use that particular type of weapon or spell.

There is a day-night cycle (on the world map only), which influences people's schedules: at night the shops are closed, but certain characters might appear only during that time.</synopsis>

      <genre>Strategy</genre>
      <synopsis>Solid Force is a turn-based strategy game that casts the player in the role of Sho Masaki, a member of an organization known as "Mars". The group consists of highly trained agents and specializes in performing classified missions for various countries. Sho's first mission is to infiltrate a base in East Africa at the request of the African Federation.

The game is composed out of large-scaled tactical battles. The player navigates the combatants over the screen and tries to accomplish missions without having the main hero killed. Most of the attacks in the game are ranged, and each weapon has unique properties. It is possible to choose full or spreading attacks with many firearms, throw bombs and use special abilities. Weapons have limited ammunition, and must be equipped manually before using. Powerful area attacks can be executed, but they damage everyone in the area, including player-controlled characters. Robot-like machines can be controlled directly by the player or set on auto mode.</synopsis>

      <title>Sorcerian</title>
      <genre>Action,RPG</genre>
      <synopsis>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.

The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Sotsugyō is the first game in the series, released only in Japan. It puts the player into a position of a high school teacher, whose goal is to successfully lead five female students to graduation within the same semester. In order to do that, the player has to study the individual characteristics of the girls. Each girl has different parameters, different strengths and weaknesses. The teacher should be careful not to overload the students with work, but letting them do what they want is not the right way either. The teacher has also control on other aspects of the students' life: it is possible to have personal conversations with the girls to motivate them, and choose leisure activities for them (such as going to the cinema). The girls can become displeased with the teacher or sick, so it's important to keep the morale high in order to achieve successful graduation.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Graduation is a Japanese anime "life-sim" game. You take the role of a homeroom teacher who is given the responsibility of teaching five girls in their last year of high school. You determine their class schedules, do guidance counseling, interfere with their weekend plans, and occasionally take to the streets to make sure they're not getting into trouble. Each of the girls have their own individual personality and problems, and the choices you make will determine whether they graduate from high school, what they do with their lives afterwards, and whether or not they wind up hating your guts. Get them all into top colleges and your boss will praise your genius. If they all flunk or wind up wanting to marry you, you'll obviously be fired.

Despite what common sense and knowledge of the Japanese psyche might lead you to believe, this is not an adult (or hentai) game and there's no nudity and only an average amount of anime sexploitation.</synopsis>

The protagonists' names have been changed to Naoki Muraoka (Sotsugyō Shashin) and Tetsuya Watanabe (Miki).

While the gameplay of Miki remains largely unchanged, this version of Sotsugyō Shashin allows the player to choose Hiromi Kamura as the protagonist, which adds a second scenario to the game where the same events are presented from her point of view. The gameplay system has underwent a few tweaks, making some of the player's choices influence the course of the story. While the original game only had one ending, this version has seven endings for Naoki's scenario and ten for Hiromi's.</synopsis>

      <title>Space Invaders - The Original Game</title>
      <synopsis>This version of Space Invaders is based on the 1994 arcade game Space Invaders DX but lacks the parody mode of that game. What remains is the classic mode that allows the player to choose the type of arcade cabinet (upright, black &amp; white, etc.) as background to the action as well as the versus mode for two players. The versus mode is split-screen, each player trying to survive and eliminate more invaders than the opponent.

The Game Boy version has both one- and two-player modes using the usual Game Boy tones (black and grey). However, plugging the cart into a Super Game Boy allows playing the game in all four cabinet types of the SNES version. 

The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version offers an additional "cosmic versus" mode, where the background is composed of anime-style pictures of girls. They also appear in the "omake mode", which is a single-player variant with the same backgrounds.

The WonderSwan version doesn't offer all four cabinet types (only black &amp; white) but keeps the versus mode.</synopsis>

He was testing the newest spacecraft model, but it crash-landed on Menaris, a planet at the outskirts of the Eva solar system, with a medieval-like civilization. Turns out that repairing the ship will be anything but easy, so Harry decides to stay for a while and to help the inhabitants of Menaris with their problems, which involve the over-ambitious Doran Empire. With the help of Aria, princess of Menaris, Harry must discover the truth about Doran's intentions, and when he learns it, he realizes that he won't use the repaired ship to return home, but will have to face something that threatens the entire galaxy.

Star Breaker is a fairly traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down view, world map navigation, random turn-based battles, and all the other usual ingredients. Battles can be set on Auto for quicker pacing. Since the setting of the game is a mixture of sci-fi and medieval fantasy, character use a variety of weapons from swords to guns, as well as special psychic attacks.

The battles are viewed from first-person perspective. Characters can use regular attacks as well as magical spells, and the battles can be also set on Auto.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A mad scientist named Dr. Killbait succeeded in resurrecting one of the eight ancient dragons, endangering the country of Hyneld. The captain of the king's knights, Robin Solford, witnesses the dragon's attack on the castle. His two comrades are killed, and the princess Patricia, Robin's adoptive sister, is nowhere to be seen. Robin is determined to find Patricia and stop Dr. Killbait, and begins to wander around the world, hoping to find friends who will help him on his perilous journey.

Startling Odyssey II: Maryū Sensō is not a sequel, but a prequel to the first game, Robin Solford being the father of the previous game's hero. The game is set in a predominantly medieval fantasy-themed world with a touch of sci-fi, and plays like a traditional Japanese RPG. The player navigates a party of characters on a top-down overworld, visiting cities and dungeon-like areas. Enemies are encountered randomly. Battles are viewed from isometric perspective, with an "auto" option to speed up combat.

Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; the party will eventually contain four active combatants. Each character has his or her own sets of offensive, supporting, or healing spells, which are learned automatically when the character levels up. The game features full-screen anime-style cutscenes and voice acting during important events.</synopsis>

The game takes place in the far future, on an alien planet dominated by seven elf-like or catgirl princesses that have fallen under the spell of a unique virus that has driven them mad and threatens to destroy the planet if all the rulers declare all-out war.

Only Blondia Varady (nicknamed "Blow") and his sister Fallandia have been spared from the disease and must pilot their fighter ships in order to penetrate deep into the domain of each princess, destroy their war machines, and administer the antidote. Fortunately for Blow, the antidote has been synthesized into his reproductive organ, so that means there is only one way to inoculate the girls....

The player controls the fighter ship through vertically scrolling stages, trying to destroy every ship that crosses its path and reach the end boss. The ship has a primary weapon that can be constantly upgraded by collecting power-ups, and a secondary slot for all sorts of collectible weapons that can be picked up in mid-air. The game features 2P-cooperative gameplay and cutscenes made of still images that explain the plot and depict the protagonist's encounters with each princess.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Strider, released in Japan as Strider HiryÅ« (ã¹ãã©ã¤ãã¼é£ç«?) is a 1989 side-scrolling platform game released for the CP System arcade hardware by Capcom. It became one of Capcom's early hits before Street Fighter II, revered for its innovative gameplay and multilingual voice clips during cutscenes (presented in English, Japanese, Mandarin, Russian and Spanish). 

Strider is set in a dystopian future in the year 2048, where a mysterious dictator known as the "Grandmaster" rules over the world. Hiryu, the youngest ever Super A Ranked[2] member of a organization of high-tech ninja-like agents known as the "Striders", is alone tasked with the Grandmaster's assassination. Hiryu begins his mission by infiltrating the Grandmaster's capital at the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. 

NEC Avenue produced a PC Engine version of Strider Hiryu, which was released exclusively in Japan on September 22, 1994. The PC Engine version was released as a CD-ROMÂ² title which requires the Arcade Card expansion. The PC Engine port features an all-new desert stage that was not in the arcade version, as well as newly recorded cut-scenes, music and dialogue, with Japanese voice actor Kaneto Shiozawa as the voice of Hiryu and KÅji Totani as the Grand Master. The PC Engine version is notable for its long development process, having been planned in various formats, including the ill-fated SuperGrafx at one point</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Nariagari Trendy is an adaptation of the Japanese board game sugoroku - the Monopoly-like "Game of Life" version rather than the backgammon variant. Four characters, controlled by human players or computer AI, move on a board that represents a city, earning money and points on the way. The characters are taken from other Laser Soft games, most prominently Cosmic Fantasy series. The amount of moves is determined by dice roll. Special fields would award the character that lands on them with large amounts of money, the opportunity to roll the dice again, or lead to various mini-games which would increase the character's possessions. Another type of fields leads to a store run by the cat Nyan from Cosmic Fantasy games, who offers special cards for money.</synopsis>

      <title>Summer Carnival '92 - Alzadick</title>
      <synopsis>Alzadick is a vertically-scrolling sci-fi shoot-em-up designed for Naxat Soft's Summer Carnival of 1992, a game competition similar to Hudson's Caravan Tournament. The game specifically focuses on beating high scores, and as such introduces Score Attack and Time Attack modes, both short segments of shoot-em-up gameplay that challenge players to reach a high score (in case of Time Attack, within a limited amount of time). There is also a story mode split into two episodes (both based on sci-fi-themed futuristic scenarios); however, there is no actual plot development in-game, and the episodes are very short compared to standard-length shooters.



Like in most games of the kind, the player controls a spaceship and tries to eliminate or avoid on-screen enemies. Power-ups take the shape of the letters A, B, C, and D; each corresponds to a weapon of specific color and properties (e.g. spreading fire, side fire, etc.), though they are fairly similar to each other in function. A powerful sub-weapon that hits all enemies on screen comes in four variants and can only be used once.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Released specifically for Naxat Soft's Summer Carnival of 1993, Nexzr Special is a collection of short stages and modes that share their basic gameplay system and visuals with Nexzr. The regular mode introduces familiar regular enemies and a few new bosses. The "Carnival Mode" contains Score Attack and Time Attack modes, both requiring the player to focus on attaining the high score rather than just surviving. For that reason the difficulty in these modes is more forgiving; they allow more continues and have more generously placed power-ups. These modes also offer more destructible objects on the screen, as these specifically serve to increase the score.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>After the success of PC Denjin, our hero leaps onto CD with a whole new game and a whole new soundtrack. Flying over the various landscapes (you get to choose which order to play the first four levels in), you come up against tidal waves, giant robots and a general array of nasty but cute bad guys as you would expect. The plants from the original PC Kid games are still here to provide such joys as extra firepower, fountains of smiley faces or the tiny-denjin which makes dodging bullets that little bit easier. Another handy little trick is that your boots also pack a punch, so backing into an enemy is more likely to dispose of them than do you any permanent damage. Part way along each of the levels you get the chance to rescue a friend who then joins with you, giving you a specific extra ability. These friends are pre-set one per level and cannot be chosen, and they allow things like rapid-sushi-fire and handy rear shots.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Super Albatross is a golf game. There are three modes available: training, match play, and tournament. Match play is essentially a story mode that casts the player in the role of a young man whose mother has passed away and who tries to find solace in golf. In this mode, opponents must be defeated in a linear fashion and courses are dictated by the story. In training and tournament modes the player can choose between six different courses. The tournament mode is a competition between various characters who appeared as opponents in the match play mode. The golf game itself is viewed from a top-down perspective at all times, and allows the player to choose the type of club as well as adjust the angle and the strength of the shot.</synopsis>

      <genre>Strategy</genre>
      <synopsis>Super Daisenryaku is one of the many titles in SystemSoft's long-running war strategy series. The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.

The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya), to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members.

Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.</synopsis>

Among the differences is the possibility to select a portrait of the main character (male or female) and a few additional historical characters to compete against: for example, the medieval Japanese warlord Oda Nobunaga is now joined by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu, famous historical characters of the same era. The roster of modern characters (in particular developers such as Kou Shibusawa) has been expanded as well. Like in the previous game, the grand tournament mode can only be accessed after the player has sufficiently advanced in the ranking.</synopsis>

      <title>Super Schwarzschild</title>
      <genre>Strategy</genre>
      <synopsis>Super Schwarzschild is a spin-off entry in the Schwarzschild series. The game's scenario is based on that of Schwarzschild II. The story is much more elaborate and character-specific; unlike the earlier game, there is a linear plot advanced through dialogue and anime-style cutscenes. The player takes control of Alcion, the crown prince of the Auraclume kingdom, who is forced to terminate his studies abroad and return to his country in order to defend it against a treacherous enemy.

The gameplay system is vastly different as well; as opposed to the main entries in the series, Super Schwarzschild is not a grand strategy game. The gameplay is confined to much smaller areas and is also significantly more linear and mission-oriented. Rather than presenting free-form gameplay and interaction with a multitude of nations, the game is restricted to a single military conflict. Diplomacy options are completely gone; finances, resource management, and research have been simplified. Much of the game is dedicated to military strategy and tactics, involving arming and deploying ships. Battles are actively controlled by the player; they take place on separate small screens and require the player to navigate ships and attack enemy craft in turn-based fashion.</synopsis>

Like other Schwarzschild games, it is set in the 40th century and portrays a complex political and military situation within a star system. The events of the game take place in or around the once powerful kingdom of Istramu, which was severely weakened by the king's death. Temporary leaders replaced each other, and the instability led to a global revolt in the surrounding space. The player takes the role of various characters belonging to the resistance movement.

Like the previous game, Super Schwarzschild has less grand strategy elements than the main Schwarzschild installments, and focuses on smaller-scale military strategy and tactics. There are no diplomacy options; resource management and research are simplified. There are more belligerents and somewhat more freedom in strategic planning than in the preceding game. Battles take place on separate screens and follow a turn-based tactical model. Similarly to the predecessor, the game features extensive cutscenes and dialogue that advance the plot.</synopsis>

      <genre>RPG</genre>
      <synopsis>One night, a lone, grim-looking traveler who calls himself Ax appears in a pub at the outskirts of Satania castle. He meets Althea, a girl from a village whose inhabitants were massacred by orcs. The two travel to the castle, where they meet the king of Satania, and learn of an ancient powerful artifact that has now caused the resurrection of a powerful demon. Ax reveals his own demonic heritage, but is willing to join forces with the people of the kingdom and fight against his kin...

Completely unrelated to an earlier game of the same name, Sword Master is a tactical RPG, i.e. a hybrid of Japanese-style RPG and strategic battles. The player controls a small party at first, but later can command several units. Most of the gameplay takes place on the battle fields. The player navigates the heroes in turn-based fashion, attacking or casting magic when the enemy is in range. Attacks are presented as short full-screen animated sequences. Characters gain experience after each attack and might level up in the middle of the battle.

Unlike many other games of this kind, Sword Master contains an additional RPG element in the possibility to navigate the characters in real time in towns and other "friendly" areas. The story progression, however, is completely linear, and the player can not explore hostile areas.</synopsis>

      <genre>Action,Shooter,</genre>
      <synopsis>In Terraforming, the human race has fled into the depths of space after Earth has become uninhabitable. As a result, they travel from planet to planet in an attempt to find a planet suitable enough to terraform into a new Earth. Along the way they encounter alien races which they must destroy in an attempt to survive and continue the human race.

The gameplay is a basic side-scrolling shooter, shooting down enemy space ships, picking up power-ups and health icons and upgrading main and secondary weapons along with the obligatory huge stage bosses. The most notable feature of the game is the work done by Syd Mead, a special effects artist for such films as Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Blade Runner, Aliens, 2010 and as recent as Mission Impossible III.</synopsis>

      <title>Sylphia</title>
      <synopsis>Sylphia is a vertical shooter published by Tonkin House. The game draws from Greek mythology and tells the story of Sylphia, a female warrior with a tragic destiny. Her tale starts as she lays fatally wounded in the temple of Athena - merciless monsters have taken over the city and she perished as she desperately tried to protect innocent villagers. The gods, touched by the sincerity of the young woman's devotion and love, decide to give Sylphia another chance... Now turned into a Sylphid with tremendous powers, the female warrior embarks on a long journey of revenge, ready to fight for her homeland. Sylphia starts equipped with a fairly basic fire weapon that can be upgraded in various ways - four different types based on the four basic elements are available throughout the game, from Fire (Red), Air (Green), Water (Blue) and Earth (Brown). Each weapon type is associated with an additional sub-weapon which range from Homing Fireballs (Red), Reverse Fire (Blue), Ring Blades (Green) and Rotating Rocks (Brown). Sylphia can also trigger a devastative special attack that deals great damage to on-screen enemies - this power is obviously available in limited quantities and may only be be used in desperate situations. Various other items are available for the taking, such as extra lives, Mirrors/Gems (slowly increase a health bar located at the bottom of the screen that gives the player an extra life when full) and Green Orbs (increase the active weapon's power level). Sylphia consists of eight stages and is single player only.</synopsis>

      <title>Tadaima Yuusha Boshuu-chuu</title>
      <genre>Role-Playing</genre>
      <synopsis>Tadaima Yūsha Boshūchū is a semi-humorous title that incorporates elements of role-playing and strategy board game. The game is set in a medieval fantasy land populated by various races; when the country is overrun by demonic invaders, the king cowardly avoids responsibility and puts the task of liberating it into the hands of a group of heroes. Four players (human or AI-controlled) select their characters, each representing an exotic race, and take them on a quest to free the land.

Navigation is done in a board game style; each of the players rolls dice, which determines the amount of moves the character can make. Characters belong to different classes and have unique attributes, abilities, hit and magic points, etc. In towns the characters can rest, purchase magic spells of various levels and elemental disciplines, buy items, and hire companions in bars. These companions also come in many varieties (magic users, monks, barbarians, etc.), and it is necessary to create a balanced party with spellcasters, healers and physically tough characters to prevail.

Fields the characters land on may lead to random events such as stats and money increase, as well as battles. The latter are handled in traditional Japanese-style, turn-based RPG fashion, viewed from a Final Fantasy-like perspective. The player inputs commands (attack, magic, item, etc.) until the enemies are defeated, at which point battle spoils are acquired. Towns are often overrun by tougher enemies and can be liberated by vanquishing them. Should two player-controlled parties meet each other on the same field, they can opt to fight each other.</synopsis>

      <genre>Strategy,</genre>
      <synopsis>Taiheiki is a turn-based strategy game based on the Japanese 14th century historical epic of the same name. Like the book, the game portrays the struggle between the Northern Court, ruled by the decadent Hōjō clan (later betrayed by their vassal Ashikaga Takauji), and the Southern Court of the emperor Go-Daigo. The gameplay has strong grand strategy elements and is similar to Koei's "historical simulation" series. The player can choose to control either the Northern or the Southern forces, choosing the actions for the leader and all his vassals. The player can choose to engage in diplomacy with rulers of other provinces, sign agreements, and manage and navigate armies. Combat takes place on a separate top-down grid, on which he player navigates the soldiers in turn-based fashion. Individual battles proceed automatically, their outcome based on the participant's attributes.</synopsis>

Play the part of the head of a railroad company, with the aim of creating a railroad empire, providing a successful mass transit system that will be an inspiration to the rest of the world. Another goal is to provide the impetus for a chosen city to develop. There are a number of different places to set up business each with different layouts and existing houses and businesses.

The main money earners are passenger trains, that can be scheduled to pick up passengers at the times of day when the demand is high. However, in the long term you need the city to develop. This requires setting up trains that transport resources to where they are needed. These resources are used to build houses, and other buildings, increasing the number of passengers for commuter trains.

As the city develops, new businesses will spring up, such as stadiums, high rise office blocks, and ski resorts. The player may also build own businesses, the success of which will depend on the local population, the presence of competing businesses, and even the changes of the seasons, among other factors. 

The stock market is also another way of making money. The player may also watch the seasons come and go, with snow visible in winter, and fireworks displays celebrating the New Year.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Tanjō: Debut puts the player into the role of a music company agent, who has to work with three potential stars of entertainment: three young girls named Aki, Kumi, and Saori. In the beginning of the game, the player views the statistics of each girl and her personality description. Afterwards, the training begins. Most of the game is spent planning schedules for the girls. Practicing music skills, working, having a vacation - everything has an influence on the girls' statistics. It is important to keep the girls happy and reduce their stress; at the same time, having vacations without practicing will diminish their professional skill. Keeping the right balance is the key here.

After a period of training, the player chooses which specific branch he/she wants the girls to compete in: commercial photos (model), staging a musical, performing a pop concert, making a movie, etc. Depending on the player's preparations and previous training, the girls will get higher or lower ratings. The player-controlled group competes against other agencies in a league, and results are shown after each major event.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Tenchi Muyō! Ryō-ōki is based on the manga and anime series Tenchi Muyo, in particular the 20-episode OVA Tenchi Muyo: Ryo-ohki (same name as the game, but with a slightly different official romanization). The story centers around a seemingly ordinary boy Tenchi Masaki, who lives in the countryside on the Earth. After accidentally releasing a spaced pirate named Ryoko, his modest house attracts the attention of powerful people from space, including an officer of the Galaxy Police, a famous scientist, and two sisters from a royal family in search of their long-lost half-brother. Soon Tenchi finds out the truth about his own identity and his super-powers, but still can't quite handle a household with five attractive young women, some of which seem to have a special interest in him...

The game is a traditional Japanese-style adventure: no puzzles, but many situations during which the player has to make choices. These choices lead to branching story lines, which in their turn lead to different endings. The game is viewed from first-person perspective, beside navigation around Tenchi's house, which uses a platform view.</synopsis>

Deden no Den was released the following year, and is near-enough the exact same game. All the Bombermen have been replaced with Kabuki Denjirou, a character from the Tengai Makyou / Far East of Eden RPG series (most of which were co-developed and published by Hudson Soft).

The young couple receives a task of retrieving and delivering a magic flower known as Eureka to the king. However, on the way to the castle, they are attacked by a winged monster, who carries Krea away. Kearu realizes that this kidnapping was not accidental, and had something to do with Krea's mysterious origin.

Tenshi no Uta is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game. As in most games of this genre, the player navigates the party of heroes on the top-down world map, fighting randomly appearing enemies, gaining experience for further automatic leveling-up, and money to buy better weapons, armor, and items. The battles are viewed from first-person perspective, with the enemy graphics super-imposed on the exploration screen (like in Cosmic Fantasy 2). The game has the conventional HP and MP bars, with the heroes learning various attack, support, and healing spells as dictated by their level.

There is a day and night cycle in the game. Shops are closed at night, and certain characters appear only at a specific day time.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Fate is a young man whose job is to patrol the land around his village and protect it from monsters. One day, during such a patrol, Fate and his friend Shion encounter a mysterious girl in the nearby tower. She could only remember that her name was Rhianna, but nothing else about her origins and how she ended up being in that tower. Shortly afterwards, the village is attacked by monsters and burnt down. Fate, Shion, and Rhianna escape, and Fate promises Rhianna that he will help her regain her memory and find the truth about her past.

Tenshi no Uta II: Datenshi no Sentaku is not directly related to its predecessor story-wise (though it is set in the same universe, and some characters from the previous game make an appearance here). Graphically and gameplay-wise, it is nearly identical to it, with the exception of a few minor tweaks (such as characters regaining full health after level up): an archetypal Japanese-style RPG with random enemies, turn-based combat, linear story progression, and automatic character growth. Like the first game, Datenshi no Sentaku has a day and night cycle.</synopsis>

The gameplay is dedicated almost entirely to planning schedules, getting the maximum out of the date with the chosen girl. A date is not necessarily automatic success - neglecting a girl for a long time will lead to gossip and eventually may destroy the relationship. There is also a "rival" in the game, a male student who might succeed with one of the girls if the player is not careful enough.</synopsis>

      <title>Top O Nerae! Gunbuster Vol. 1</title>
      <genre>Adventure,Visual Novel,</genre>
      <synopsis>Top o Nerae! GunBuster Vol.1 is based on the anime OVA series Gunbuster by Gainax. In the early 21th century humanity discovered a race of bug-like aliens while colonizing known space. The aliens steadily advance towards the Earth with the goal of eradicating it. To counter that, humans have developed giant mechas that ca be navigated by trained pilots. The story of the game follows closely the first chapter of the anime, focusing on the young pilot Noriko Takaya and her first steps towards the mastery of her dangerous profession.

The game has a Japanese-style adventure-like interface (with Look, Talk, and other verb commands leading to sub-menus), but plays more like a cross between an interactive movie (with animated scenes and voice-overs) and a visual novel, where choices of actions and responses play a dominant role. Every wrong action raises the heroine's "stress meter"; once it is full, the game is over.</synopsis>

      <genre>Adventure,</genre>
      <synopsis>Top o Nerae! GunBuster Vol.2 is a direct sequel to the first episode based on the Gunbuster anime series. It continues the story started in the first chapter, following the adventures of the young mecha pilot Noriko Takaya as she passes the test and is admitted into the fighting squad of mechas, sent on a mission to stop an insectoid race of aliens from destroying the Earth.

Gameplay-wise, the second episode differs from the previous one in that it eschews even the rudimentary Japanese-style adventure commands. It plays more like a pure interactive movie: the player watches animated, voiced scenes and from time to time has to make a decision for Noriko, influencing subsequent scenes. The "stress meter" from the preceding game has been removed as well. The game also contains extras such as character and robot introduction, a radio drama, and a "rock-paper-scissors" game against Noriko.</synopsis>

      <title>Tv Show</title>
      <genre>Action,Arcade,</genre>
      <synopsis>The TV Show is a humorous overhead action game similar to Bomberman in concept. The game consists of a scenario mode (single-player) and a versus mode (up to four players). Both modes offer seven characters to choose from. The characters are comically-themed and include a hyperactive schoolgirl, an armored ninja, and others. There is no real storyline behind these characters; each comes with a short introduction sequence that invariably leads to their admittance to an alien-organized TV show, where they have to defeat enemies and retrieve prizes.

Each stage is an overhead screen containing the protagonist, enemies, the prize, and several bombs. The bombs should be picked up and carried around; they are used to deal with enemies and blow up the receptacle in which the prize is contained. The green bombs change their color to yellow and red when picked up, at which point they are about to explode and have to be thrown to avoid damage. Bombs also blow holes in the terrain, and the player must pay attention not to fall through. In addition to bomb-carrying and bomb-throwing, each character possesses a special ability. These range from throwing projectiles at enemies to speeding up when driving a bike, depending on the selected character.</synopsis>

      <title>Uchuu Senkan Yamato</title>
      <genre>Strategy</genre>
      <synopsis>Uchū Senkan Yamato is based on the anime series Space Battleship Yamato, also known as Star Blazers. The events of the game follow those of the initial episodes. In the end of the 22nd century, Gamila aliens bombard Earth with radioactive meteorites. As a result, the planet's surface becomes uninhabitable, and humans begin to dwell underground. Using the ruins of the World War II Japanese battleship Yamato, humans construct a powerful spaceship and can finally engage the aliens in direct confrontation.

This incarnation of the series is essentially a real-time strategy game with a somewhat unusual approach to the genre. Rather than navigating units on battlefields, the player takes direct control of every crew member onboard the ship. Each one of them is responsible for a certain function (supplying power, manning a gun, turning the ship, etc.); in order to win battles, it is crucial to coordinate their actions. The game proceeds in real time, but pauses when the player accesses crew members and performs actions for them.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Urusei Yatsura: Stay with You is based on the manga series by Rumiko Takahashi. The protagonist is Ataru Moroboshi, a high school student who accidentally evokes love in the heart of Lum, the princess of an alien demon-like race. The game does not recount the initial events of the manga and instead is built like an episode, assuming the player's familiarity with the general story and characters. Ataru's ex-girlfriend Shinobu disappears under mysterious circumstances. Ataru and Lum must explore the high school building and find out what happened to Shinobu.

The gameplay is that of a traditional Japanese-style adventure, where all interaction (including navigation) is performed by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects from a list. game progression is fairly linear, and it is typically required to complete an objective in one location in order to be able to proceed to the next one. There are no real puzzles, but an inventory with items that can be examined is present.</synopsis>

But Rogles got jealous and made a scheme to kill Megas so he could became the darkworld's next king. Megas survived but had to repleace many of his body parts with machinery. Later he discovered that the one behind that conspiracy wasn't Rogles but Kaiza himself who, when discovered by Megas, banished him to a dimensional abyss from where he remained a long time growing a hatreness for his brother and his father. That's why he wanted to finish Rogles army's remains and dominate Vecanti.

      <synopsis>Mugen Senshi Valis IV (å¤¢å¹»æ¦å£«ã´ã¡ãªã¹IV, Mugen senshi Varisu fou) â also known as Mugen Senshi Valis 4: Akai Tsuki no Otome, Super Valis IV or Valis 4 â is the last of the main Valis series games. This game's events happen 15 years after those of Valis III and introduce a new protagonist: Lena Brande.
Story
Hundreds of years ago, the king Asfal from the Dark World had a son, Galgear, who was driven insane by the power of a ring that he inherited from his father, causing wars and widespread destruction in order to make that power grow constantly.

Consequently, the gods imprisoned Galgear and his followers in a giant crystal and sank it under the seas.

Many centuries have passed and the crystal emerges to the surface once again with Galgear and his army broken free, bringing an end to the short-lived era of peace enjoyed by Vecanti after Glames' defeat in Valis III.

With his reign of chaos reestablished, Glames takes over Vecanti and starts to take over the human world also. Galgear then kidnaps Vecanti's current queen, Valna, and prepares her execution.

Meanwhile, a resistance force in the dream world led by Cham tries to fight Galgear's regime but this seems to be useless. Lena, a member of the resistance, decides to rescue Valna along with her sister Amu. Although Cham isn't in accordance with her, she hears Yuuko's voice telling her to let Lena go. Having no other option, Cham teaches them some basic things and then stays behind in Vecanti guarding the city and the survivors.

Lena and Amu manage to infiltrate Castle Vanity and defeat the first of Galgear's generals, Dhalgen. Then they find Valna and try to rescue her just to be stopped and injured by Galgear himself, meeting him personally for the first time. Just as he is going to deal the heroines the final blow, they are teleported away by a stranger who reveals himself to be Asfal, Galgear's father himself, who also wants to stop his son's evil regime. He tells Lena that the only thing that can defeat his son is the Valis sword, which isn't in this world anymore, and that they have to reach Valhalla in the sky in order to obtain It from Yuuko, the most recent Valis warrior and current guardian of the sword.

After overcoming many obstacles, they meet Yuuko who warns Lena about the things she will have to live as a Valis warrior by showing her memories and asks if she still wants to become a Valis warrior. Lena answers decidedly that she will accept that destiny if she can save the three worlds from Galgear. Yuuko then tests her with satisfactory results and gives her the Valis sword and thus the Valis armor.

Afterward, the three protagonists make their way into the human world to reach the giant crystal Galgear uses as his base. After beating many of his henchmen and his last two generals, they find Galgear trying to kill Valna once again. It seems to be too late to save her, but Amu steps in front of Galgear's axe throw, saving Valna's life but being mortally injured.

Asfal releases Valna and holds off his son while Amu dies in her sister's arms. Lena then addresses Galgear, saying that she will put an end to him once and for all. Galgear challenges her to come and fight him in his lair, the red moon, where Asfal lived when he was king.

Lena and Asfal open a path to the red moon where they fight Galgear, defeating him sucessfully. Asfal and Galgear apologize to each other respectively for all that has happened, after which Galgear dies in the arms of his father. Lena then goes to Amu's grave to pay her last respects and starts to walk toward the horizon, asking herself what will await in the future.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Vasteel 2 is formally a sequel to Vasteel; it is also set in the eponymous fictional, futuristic solar system and deals primarily with strategic battles between robots. However, its story is not directly connected with that of the predecessor. The main hero is a young boy named Voice Knuckles, who enjoys a peaceful life with his mother and his girlfriend Diggy. But the cruel Emperor Agares attacks his planet and destroys Voice's home, killing his mother in the process. The boy swears revenge. Aided by his girlfriend and his friends, he assembles a rebel army from fighters who navigate giant robots, and is determined to defeat Agares at all costs.

The game is more story-heavy than its predecessor, and has more clearly pronounced anime/manga aesthetics. Animated cut scenes occur between the missions and advance the story. Even during the large strategic battles, characters would often engage in dialogue, and scripted events might occur.

The gameplay also underwent some changes. Vasteel 2 is, like its predecessor, a hex-based, turn-based strategy game with robotic combat; however, the action sequences are gone, and the battles now proceed automatically, as in most games of this genre. Robot production and financial management were also simplified or removed. However, the player can choose to use various types of weapons before engaging an enemy in combat. For example, robots can use melee attacks, bipedal tanks can use different laser beams, etc.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Wizardry III・IV contains two role-playing games from the Wizardry series: Legacy of Llylgamyn and The Return of Werdna. Both games were ported to the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD console with various enhancements, unreleased separately. The player automatically starts playing Legacy of Llylgamyn; playing The Return of Werdna can be accessed via "Utility" option in the town menu. Though the game(s) are rather faithful in gameplay and graphical design to the original computer versions, the enhancements are significant enough to consider this a remake.

Unlike the computer originals with their vector lines, the dungeons have simple graphics now. Enemy sprites are also drawn in a more detailed fashion. A pre-made party of six is available to the player right at the beginning, consisting of characters with generic names ("Fighter", "Samurai", etc.); creating own characters (unlike in the modified PC Engine CD version of Might and Magic), however, remains possible. Naturally, in The Return of Werdna the player controls Werdna himself and his summoned monsters. Another notable change is the inclusion of orchestrated CD audio music for dungeon navigation and (optionally) for battle music.</synopsis>

      <title>Wizardry V : Heart of the Maelstrom</title>
      <genre>Role-Playing</genre>
      <synopsis>After L'Kbreth's Orb was used to bring peace back to the land of Llylgamyn, a new threat emerges in the region. Strange malevolent energies have been spotted beneath the Temple of Sages. These energies - called the "Maelstrom" by the local inhabitants - can be sealed by a person known as the Gatekeeper. Unfortunately, the latter has been imprisoned by a mysterious power or person only referred to as SORN. A party of brave adventurers seeks out the high priest G'bli Gedook, the guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb, who explains to them that they have to release the Gatekeeper and eventually vanquish the evil at its core.

Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom returns to the gameplay concept of the first three installments of the series, abandoning the unusual premise of its predecessor. As in the initial games, the gameplay consists of exploring a vast maze-like dungeon with a custom party created and outfitted in the game's only town. Though visually very similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.

The game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion. It is the first installment in the series with friendly NPCs who can be encountered in the dungeon and interacted with by typing keywords. Also for the first time, the game allows - but does not require - importing characters from a previous scenario.</synopsis>

      <title>Wonder Boy III : Monster Lair</title>
      <synopsis>Feeling more like the first Wonder Boy than the second, Monster Lair is a fast-paced auto scrolling platform game. The levels are split into two stages, the first being a platform stage, the second a shoot 'em up stage which ends in a boss. During the game your energy counts down, so you must keep picking up fruit to replenish yourself. There are a variety of weapons to collect - lasers, spread shots, spinning shields and so on, but these are also on a timer and do not last long, so weapon switching is frequent to avoid being left with your basic short range sword shot. The game is single or two player simultaneous.</synopsis>

The original eight characters from the previous game return, along with six new characters hand-picked from several different eras and locations all through time. Who or what is behind this new tournament? In order to find that out, the strongest fighter must defeat all the opponents, win the title, and face the one who has all the answers.

The second World Heroes game features new stages and music, as well as improved animation and graphics. Fighters can now reflect projectile moves at their opponents, and reverse normal throws if the player's timing is right. The original game's Death Match mode is also back, but with a new feature - the life bar will increase or decrease as the fighter inflicts or receives damage. If the player manages to get his fighter's life bar to 100%, the enemy will lose.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were "real" (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used.</synopsis>

    Xak II: Rising of the Redmoon

More than just a compilation, this version was developed from scratch, featuring more detailed graphics, new musical compositions, voice acting, and new cut scenes, including a common intro for both games. The improved interface from the second game is now present during the first as well. Even though gameplay-wise this release is very similar to the originals, there are some slight changes as well: enemies are more aggressive, and sometimes appear at different spots than in the original. Although this release contains both games, they are treated as one long game, and it is only possible to start playing the second after having completed the first.</synopsis>

      <title>Xak 3 - The Eternal Recurrence</title>
      <synopsis>The great hero Latok, the descendant of the war god Duel, has returned to his hometown Fearless, where he lives peacefully with his mother. But one day, a messenger brings terrible news: the castle of Farland was attacked, the king, the princess, and countless soldiers brutally slain. Zomu Dizae, the third and the final demon commander of the dark world Zekisis (Latok has defeated the other two, Badu and Gospel), has arrived. He is aided by the treacherous Necromancer, who turned the soldiers of Farland into monsters. Will Latok be able to defeat the evil once again?

Xak III: The Eternal Recurrence is an action RPG, similar in gameplay style to its predecessors, but also incorporating some elements first introduced in Tower of Gazel, such as the ability to jump and having companions (although this feature is much more limited here). Jumping ability is crucial in many cases, as there are obstacles that can only be avoided by jumping over them. Latok starts at level 50, but still can gain experience points and become stronger. A new (and very useful) feature is hit points restoration, which occurs when Latok is standing still. To counter that, enemies can re-spawn, which means that there aren't many completely safe areas in the game.</synopsis>

      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>Kinsenka Kyō Ezara Satsujin Jiken is based on a series on a series of novels by the Japanese detective fiction author Misa Yamamura. The popular protagonist of the novels, inspector Sōsuke Kariya, appears in the game as one of the characters; but the main heroine and the player character is Yuko Kobayakawa, a journalist working for a gourmet magazine. During a trip to Kyoto she attends a party and witnesses a mysterious murder of a wealthy man's estranged wife. Yoko decides to stay and help the authorities investigate the crime.

The game plays like a puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure. Most of the time the player chooses a location to travel to and interrogates characters, selecting various topics from a list. Such scenes are presented in first-person view. A few segments, however, feature third-person navigation with point-and-click interaction, similar to Western adventures. Other instances require the player to move a cursor on a zoomed object to interact with it in a detailed way.</synopsis>

      <genre>Adventure,Visual Novel,</genre>
      <synopsis>Harukanaru Kioku is a re-imagining of earlier Yami no Ketsuzoku games. The basic plot follows the events that began in the first installment, but it is told in an entirely different fashion, with different scenes, dialogues, etc. For example, the game begins a short while before the starting point of the first chapter, and contains conversations between the protagonist Miyu Izawa and the murder victim Marie, which were not present in the original story. The visual style of the game is also quite different, with bright anime-like graphics atypical of the previous entries. Gameplay-wise, this installment also differs from the preceding computer games by greatly reducing interaction. All of the dialogue in the game is spoken, and much of the narration is revealed through Miyu's thoughts which act like cutscenes, rather than being derived from interaction with the environment. In essence, the game is a fairly linear visual novel with some occasions where the player is able to visit different locations.</synopsis>

      <title>Yawara! 2 - A Fashionable Judo Girl!</title>
      <genre>Fighter,Adventure,Quiz</genre>
      <synopsis>Based on the manga and subsequent anime series Yawara: A Fashionable Judo Girl, this game can be considered a sequel to Yawara!, since its events take place after the conclusion of the previous story line. This time, the player controls Fujiko Itou, one of the original series' heroines, an admirer of Yawara. After having won a major international competition, Yawara feels she cannot bear the fame, longing to return to normal life and leave judo. Shocked by this decision, Fujiko decides to train herself and become a judo master, in order to convince Yawara to come back.

Unlike the previous game, which was entirely a "digital comic", Yawara 2 has three different gameplay modes. The Japanese-style adventure part plays similarly to the predecessor and to most other games of this style: the player has a few verbs to choose from a menu; choosing all of them one-by-one invariably advances the story. This part is heavy on non-interactive cut scenes.

Another gameplay mode is a quiz featuring questions related to the original series; the player has to choose the correct answer among four available ones, and a wrong answer leads to instant Game Over.

Finally, the so-called "Battle" gameplay mode is a judo fighting game. It plays similarly to other fighting games (even with its own story, versus, and two-player modes), but instead of the usual punches, kicks, jumps, and special moves, the player is only allowed to execute authentic judo moves and play by the rules. Many moves involve rapid pressing of different buttons. The player controls Fujiko, and in the versus mode is able to choose to fight fictional champions from the original story line.

Beside these gameplay modes, the game features an extensive Yawara!-related database, with character profiles, information, and even the titular heroine giving a cooking lesson.</synopsis>

      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>Based on the manga Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl, the game follows the story of Yawara Inokuma, the teenage granddaughter of a famous judo master. While she is trying to have an ordinary life, her grandfather insists on her studying the martial art of judo, and she has troubles to decide what her goal in life is going to be. The game's protagonist is one of the minor characters in the manga, a young journalist named Matsuda. Seeing how Yawara effortlessly beats up an assailant on the street, Matsuda decides to find out who the "wonder girl" is, feeling that she is going to become a famous sports star.

The game is what is commonly known as digital comic, i.e. Japanese-style adventure game without puzzles and with very limited, basic interaction possibilities. Typically, the player is presented with a few verb commands and object sub-menus at every screen, and has to go through them in order to make progress. Animated and voiced cutscenes frequently occur in order to advance the narrative.</synopsis>

      <title>Yokoyama Mitsuteru Shin Sangokushi - Tenka Wa Ware Ni</title>
      <genre>Strategy,</genre>
      <synopsis>Tenka wa Ware ni is based on the Sangokushi manga by Mitsuteru Yokoyama, itself an adaptation of Eiji Yoshikawa's re-telling of the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. As such, the game includes plot elements and a few characters added by Yoshikawa or Yokoyama, but for the most part remains faithful to the general storyline of the Chinese novel and hence to the actual historical events of the Three Kingdoms Era.

The gameplay is similar to that of Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, focusing on grand strategy and country management as well as on tactical battles. There is no scenario selection, but the player can choose between multiple warlords of the three kingdoms. The player then manages the province under control of the selected warlord. It is necessary to take care of the population and army, buying provisions, training officers, and publishing edicts. Diplomacy plays an important role: pacts and agreements can be made, and it is also possible to acquire new allies through various means.

Invading (or being attacked by) another country leads to a large-scale tactical battle that takes place on hexagonal grids. The player navigates army divisions in turn-based fashion. Contact with an enemy division leads to yet another sub-mode, where the player controls units that form the division, positioning and navigating them on a smaller battle screen. The game also has a separate battle mode accessible from the main menu, where the player can recreate historical battles directly without going through grand strategy portions.</synopsis>

      <title>Yu Yu Hakusho - Anshoubu!! Ankoku Bujutsukai</title>
      <genre>Shooter</genre>
      <synopsis>Ankoku Bujutsukai is based on the manga Yū Yū Hakusho, which tells the story of a young delinquent named Yusuke Urameshi who dies and becomes reincarnated as a reward for a good deed he committed, further serving as an "underworld detective" and solving demon-related mysteries. This adaptation of the manga follows the "Dark Tournament" story arc, where members of Yusuke's team confront the powerful demon Toguro.

Despite its premise, which is reminiscent of a versus fighting game, Ankoku Bujutsukai is an arcade-style shooter. The player selects one of the five characters (Yusuke, Hiei, Kurama, Kuwabara or Genkai), and is then taken to a series of one-on-one shoot-outs in a pre-determined order. The enemy is viewed from a first-person perspective, and the player moves a cursor to aim and shoot. The gameplay system is fairly simple, allowing the player to execute three types of attacks: regular shots, charged shots, and special attacks of limited quantity. Points are received for winning fights and can be used to raise the characters' hit points, speed, or number of special moves.</synopsis>

      <title>Zan - Kagerou No Toki</title>
      <genre>Strategy</genre>
      <synopsis>Kagerō no Toki follows Yasha Enbukyoku as the next game in the Zan series.

Unlike the previous game, Kagerō no Toki contains no supernatural forces (demons), and instead focuses on concrete events of the Sengoku period in Japan, more exactly 16th century, a period of Japanese history that was marked by continuous wars and famous leaders such as Oda Nobunaga or Tokugawa Ieyasu.

The game offers more strategic possibilities than the previous installments of the series. Choosing a region of Japan and its leader, the player can perform a variety of activities, both in his country and towards other leaders. Diplomacy includes negotiation, signing contracts and peace treaties, etc.

Battles are also more in-depth than before; instead of semi-automatic encounters battles occur on a separate map, on which the player has to actively navigate his unit, before he engages the enemy in close combat.</synopsis>

      <genre>Racing,Simulation,</genre>
      <synopsis>Zero4 Champ II is a sequel to Zero4 Champ. This time, a young Japanese street racer has been defeated by an American who claims that Japan's level is not up to par. His feelings hurt, the youth ventures to the United States, trying to earn enough money and participate in races to defend his national pride.

The game is very similar to its predecessor in concept, but offers additional options in the story mode. Part-time jobs now include delivery assignments that play like overhead racing games, as well as tending to dogs of various breeds for money. The security guard assignment plays like a mini-RPG, complete with turn-based combat, experience points, and levels. In addition, it is possible to visit racing tracks and bet money on participants. The versus mode allows players to choose between three courses to compete in, racing against each other (in a top-down mode) or computer AI (first-person).</synopsis>

      <title>Zero Wing</title>
      <synopsis>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.

Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.</synopsis>
