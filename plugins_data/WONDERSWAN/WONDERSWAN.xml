      <title>Beatmania</title>
      <synopsis>This is a portable version of beatmania and as such it contains everything one could hope for in such a game, a series of music track (with reproduced vocals!), a lot of buttons to press, and a lot of vinyl to scratch.

After you select the music you want to play you'll have a vertical scroll which will indicate when you should hit one of the left directional buttons along with the music. The game also indicates when you should 'scratch' which should be be familiar to anyone who has played a beatmania arcade game. This refers to the scratching of a record, one might think that the WonderSwan is ill-equiped for such a for of input, well think again! beatmania for WonderSwan included in its packaging a miniature record that could be fitted over the right directional keys to  make scratching more realistic.

As you finish songs you'll on lock more difficult and interesting(?) tunes. The game plays vertically.</synopsis>

      <title>Buffers Evolution</title>
      <synopsis>In a post-apocalyptic future a gambling syndicate seeks to make a quick buck in the gritty remains of earth. By fusing the best of animal and mechanical traits they create three bestial androids from a bird, a lion, and a rhinoceros. Bets are taken and then the robots are loosed into hostile mazes of scrap metal on old earth. Maybe they'll even make it back alive...

The goal of BUFFERS EVOLUTION is to run through a course while collecting ten parts in the best time possible. The courses are large and vary between jungle scenes, deserts, old factories, and general mechanical wastes. These areas are cased in by electricity to stop the contests from escaping and thereby ruining the entertainment of the masses. This will keep you in the bounds of the course. With the press of a button your character will momentarily turn into a 'buffer', a sharp pisiform metallic object, while being a buffer you can destroy enemies by slamming into them, this will often bounce you in a given direction, which is useful for reaching high ledges. 

Although you do not need to get all the parts to clear an area special items can be accrued by collection parts, while on the course proper these parts will heal any damage you may have taken. Perhaps if you collect all the part in all nine areas you'll have the means to escape you captors? 

Gameplay is reminiscent of Sonic the Hedghog
 although in those games you race against a countdown while here you are merely trying to get good times.</synopsis>

      <title>Crazy Climber</title>
      <synopsis>As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.

The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 

Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The raven has made a friend. But sorrow be to this raven, for this fellow avian migrates, and will not return for seasons. Filled with sadness and regret the raven takes wing. As he soars through his lonely world his tears begin to fall... and water dying flowers. At last he knows what he must do until his friend returns, he will make new friends in the flowers. He will help them grow and spread their seeds. 

Each level in Tane wo Maku Tori contains four pillars bridged by a series of horizontal or vertical rows. These rows are different for each of the three spaces formed by the pillar. The rows may be moved up and down, one set at a time. At the foot of a column, up to three in harder areas, will be a nascent flower. Water drops will fall along the path of the pillars, which will have a different theme for each level, and eventually either fall onto the ground or a flower. Water drops will always move along a bridge if it intersects their path, drops can't go up diagonals. Drops an combine to create larger faster moving drops. Any more than three drops and it will simply fall off the pillar, or bridge, and be of no use.

When a flower gets enough rain drops, or tear drops, it will bloom, when all the flowers on the stage bloom it will be cleared. 

Enemies also roam the stage, gobbling up hydrogen based solution and plants. They follow the same laws as the drops and will move along beams when encountered, however they can go up vertical beams. Should one reach a flower it will nibble at it until dead. This ends the game; however, enemies can be destroyed by three drops combined. 

A time mode is available where the player picks a difficulty level and then plays on the level until a flower is eaten or they run out of time, each completed flower will add to the time. 

A two player mode is available through the Communication Cable

This game is played vertically.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Based on the 1996 arcade game, Densha de Go! was one of the first commercial train-driving simulation games, and went on to spawn numerous successors.

The player can choose from a variety of tracks and trains and will then have to drive the train to the designated stations while sticking to the tight schedule, stopping exactly at the marked positions, obeying all signs and signals, and ensuring passenger safety and comfort.

Whenever the player makes a mistake, points are deducted from a counter which at the start of each round is initialized to a value depending on the selected difficulty. If it reaches zero, the game is over.

The following lines are featured:

1. Sagano Main Line (Sanin Line) from Kameoka to Kyoto
2. Keihin-Tohoku Line from Shinagawa to Yokohama
3. Tokaido Main Line (JR Kyoto Line) from Kyoto to Osaka
4. Yamanote Line (Inner Circle) from Shibuya to Tokyo Station
5. Tokaido Main Line EX from Takatsuki to Osaka, part of the rapid Tokaido Main Line from the original version, but this time with stops at every station (Windows only)
6. Sagano Line EX from Kameoka to Kyoto, without the shortcut from Saga-Arashiyama to Tambaguchi from the original version (Windows only)</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The 1998 sequel of the popular Japanese train driving game by Taito has once again been ported to various home systems. For the first time on the PlayStation, it is possible to drive through the snow, and take a seat in the cockpit of a Shinkansen bullet train.

The gameplay is more arcade than simulation. The focus is on stopping at the stations at the perfect moment and position, keeping up with the schedule, obeying signals and speed limits, and ensuring the safety and comfort of the passengers. Mistakes result in points being deducted from a counter. If it reaches 0, the game is over.

The following routes are available:

1. Hokuhoku Line from Naoetsu to Uragawara
2. Tohoku Shinkansen from Morioka to Shin-Hanamaki
3. Akita Shinkansen from Akita to Omagari
4. Keihin-Tohoku Line from Shinagawa to Ueno
5. Osaka Loop Line from Osaka to Tennoji (not in the Arcade original)
6. Kagoshima Main Line from Hakata to Kokura (only in PlayStation and Windows versions)</synopsis>

      <title>Digimon Adventure 02: Tag Tamers</title>
      <synopsis>The game is based on the manga series Digimon, in which children can travel to a digital world and help good digital monsters to defeat evil ones. In this game, the two heroes, Ryou and Ken, are summoned to the Digiworld to fight against the archenemy Millenniumon and his side-kick Diablomon. Upon defeating the two evil monsters once again, the heroes realize that Millenniumon has taken a different shape and is reborn to conquer the Digiworld anew. Now you must recruit digital monsters and lead them into the ultimate battle.

The gameplay follows traditional Digimon outlines: you descend into dungeons and have your monster friends fight other monsters in turn-based combat. Upon returning to the town, you can make those monsters participate in future battles. Unlike the two previous Digimon Adventure games,  Anode and  Cathode Tamers, you cannot move over the battle field.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The game is based on the popular manga series Digimon, which follows the adventures of children who can gain access into the digital world and fight digital monsters there. In this game, the evil Milenniamon has kidnapped several children and is planning to take control over the Digiworld.

      <synopsis>This is the second game in Digimon Adventure series, a kind of an add-on to  Anode Tamer. The game is based on the popular manga Digimon. The hero, a boy named Ryou, has to travel to digital world in order to free his friends from the clutches of the evil digital monster Milenniamon.

The story of this game is identical to that of "Anode Tamer", and gameplay mechanics are exactly the same: you descend into dungeons to fight monsters in turn-based style, capture the monsters after the battles and then send them to fight new ones. The difference between the two games are the monsters themselves: "Cathode Tamers" features a brand new set of monsters, and since the beginning of the game you encounter different foes. The full collection of monsters can be achieved only if you complete both games.</synopsis>

      <title>Engacho!</title>
      <synopsis>Engacho is based on a popular Japanese children game. You play a little boy named Sunzuki, who wants to prove to his angry father that he is not a coward and can stand up against the terrible monsters of the Oops Five group. Those five guys are extremely ugly and can contaminate you with an awful disease the moment they touch you. So you should outsmart them and run away before they can catch you. The gameplay is turn-based. You enter a room with the Oops Five monsters, and move in different directions, trying to avoid collision. The catch is that each monster has his own movement style. One of them will always imitate Sunzuki and move into the same direction as he; another will, on the contrary, move into the opposite direction, etc. By planning ahead, you must be smart enough to make your moves correctly and make it to the exit before Oops Five get you. There are different modes in the game, such as training, in which you face just one monster of your choice and get used to his patterns; puzzle mode, which takes you through a series of rooms with different shapes and monsters; and battle mode, in which you are thrown into large rooms where all Oops Five members roam freely.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Final Lap 2000 is the first hand-held incarnation of Namco's Final Lap racing games. 

This version presents a number of modes, a track building feature, and only one vehicle; an open-wheel car.

The modes are as follows:

1. World Tour: in the mode the player will compete against five other racers and progress through many tracks located around the world. Although the graphics are not  very descriptive of location, the course's shape and curves will always change.

2. Arcade: in this classic mode you'll race against a single opponent through one of the many global tracks of your choosing.

3. Time Trial: here the player will attempt to make the best time on a course of his choosing. The player is the only car on the track for this mode.

The track editing feature can only be used to make simple tracks at the start of the game; however, playing the World Tour will unlock new track parts based on your performance. Using the communication cable players can transfer tracks between different copies of Final Lap 2000.</synopsis>

Fire Pro Wrestling has a stacked roster, comprised of many not-quite-copyright-infringing wrestlers like "The Bionic Man" Steve Majors ("Stone Cold" Steve Austin) and Axe Duggan (Hulk Hogan), making WCW vs. WWF vs. ECW matches possible.  The controls are much more than the typical "mash buttons until something happens" that were so popular in earlier wrestling games, instead relying on timing to properly execute a move or hold.</synopsis>

      <title>Fishing Freaks: BassRise for WonderSwan</title>
      <synopsis>Following in the footsteps of the fishing simulation/rpg Bass Rise this portable remake. Although one can no longer select the gender of  the character there  still remains a great variety of lures and poles to select. As well as five locations. Once a location has been selected a prompt to fill the tacklebox with the lures that and rod that might be most appropriate for the environment. The player then selects where to want to stand on the shore and then the ideal location for a cast.

The view then switches to a closer overhead of the body of water and the player's avatar. A power meter sways over head and should the play manage to stop the meter at just the right point he will be rewarded with his cast going closer to where he intended. Once in the water the player's lure will always be in the center of the screen.

Catching fish is no easy matter as the PlayStation version frequently points out; it is all about finesse. The player will have to entice the fish with wiggles and jolts from the lure... this is of course assuming that the player has selected the right lure. Once a fish is caught a small screen will pop up within the screen, showing a close up of the fish's shadow on the surface of the water. The player will get a chance to see if he hooked something good should the fish jump, as they reel it in.

Records can be shared by means of the Communication Cable.</synopsis>

      <title>Ganso Jajamaru-kun</title>
      <synopsis>Ganso JaJaMaru-kun is a remake of the NES platformer Ninja JaJaMaru-kun. It includes new levels and bosses that stretch the gameplay in novel ways.

Lord Namazu Dayuu has kidnapped JaJaMaru-kun's beloved Princess Sakura. This piratical lord is no laughing matter, despite his sadistically gleeful disposition, he possess an army of creatures drawn from Japanese folklore to prevent you from reuniting with your princess ever again.

The game is quite simple and plays, for the most part, much like its predecessor. Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick points in that Jajamaru-kun can break by hitting them with his head while, a common trait for arcade heroes. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.

Each of these stages has a leader who will posses some special attribute and present a new sprite. After the level in which the leader appears he/she/it will show up in the following levels as a standard level enemy often a bit weaker. Each stage gives you two minutes to complete it, except bosses and special stages. When about one minute remains Lord Namazu will send an orb of fire onto the stage that will slowly home after Jajamaru-kun.

You start the game with two extra lives and three continues. More lives can be found in the game, or by accruing points.  

There are four levels in each game area, village, graveyard, castle and town, seaside and ship, and the hidden island. However it is not enough to kill all the enemies in a stage to progress to the next area. Each level has its a cherry blossom that will descend from the top of the screen at a certain point. If you should kill all the enemies before the blossom arrives or the blossom floats of the bottom of the screen you'll go onto the next level but have to return to get it later, in this case all the enemies will have returned. Collecting all four cherry blossoms will allow you to go onto a special stage and the area boss.

Each game area has one special stage. These stages use the familiar tiers but now they scroll upwards and are littered with traps and hazards; such as, wheels of fire, falling logs, spikes, conveyor belts, etc.. As the scrolling is automatic should Jajamaru-kun not keep up and fall off the bottom of the screen he will die, touching any deadly hazard will also dispatch our hero. Should the player reach the top of the tiers he will be confronted with a gate that his shuriken will open, this leads to a boss.

Each area boss is attacked in a unique boxed in area, sometimes with platforms. The final boss is the only area where Jajamaru-kun may throw his shuriken vertically. There are no power-ups in boss rooms.

The power-ups that can be found in the bricks between tiers wear out after a certain amount of time, with the exception of the frog. They will appear on the upper right hand corner of the screen so you know which ones you've picked up recently, getting the frog clears this list.

1. Invisibility potion: an invisible ninja is an unstoppable ninja. Once a ninja takes the potion you'll become an ninja outline and can go through enemies. Nothing can harm you, but that doesn't limit your ability to dispatch foes.

2. Ninja Cart: this is a small velocoped for ninja, one in this cart you'll be able to kill enemies by barreling into them, even though it doesn't make physical sense you can still jump in this cart.

3. Big Shuriken: this will make your ninja stars about as big as you are, easily defeating evasive enemies

4. Long Distance: this weapon upgrade will make your attacks go across the entire screen.

5. Katana: a fearsome sword, the katana can do away with any foe, regardless of if they have armor or are to low to hit with your normal attack. The katana also destroys incoming projectiles, however, this blade has a very limited range so be careful.

6. Boomerang: causes your shuriken to fly back at you, it wont harm you, but it is great for picking off foes that are weak from behind.

7. Speed increase: this spherical power-up increases Jajamaru-kun speed to the the peril of his enemies, and himself.

8. Watch: this item will give you more time.

9. Extra Ninja: this item will grant you an extra life, very rare! They do not count as a collected item.

10. Inscribed Coin: these coins available in white and black are worth varying amounts of points. They do not count as a collected item.

11. Bombs: these items look like two speed boost orbs, or the wheels of the cart, however, they are a trap. Jumping into these means instant death for Jajamaru-kun

12. Trusty Frog: Jajamaru-kun's noble steed, a humongous man-eating frog. Should you collect four power-ups instead of receiving the power of the fourth you will get to ride on your gigantic frog and eat all the enemies on the stage. This can be dangerous though if you have not yet gotten the stages petal as once on the frog it won't show up. There is no time limit on how long the frog stays, unless of course the time runs out entirely before you gobble up all the enemies. Once a stage ends you will have to repeat the item collection process to ride the frog again. Items in your collection carry over between stages so you can strategically pick a fourth on a stage where you need the frog.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>"Langrisser Millennium" is yet another installment of the long-running Japanese strategy RPG series. You control five main characters: Taji, a young boy whom was chosen as the ruler of the country Salem; Nei Lee Sun, the ruler of Chin, who helps Taji when he gets involved in a war; Masariva, a half-beast and a former slave who became a queen, but preferred the life of a wanderer; Rumaty Marf, the queen of the country Misla, on a quest for an angel who appeared in her dream; and Saryune, the ruler of Vidern, whose only desire is power. Those five rulers meet each other, when they get involved in a war with hostile countries. However, soon they learn a greater evil has appeared in the world - they must reach a faraway island to prevent the reincarnation of an evil god...

The gameplay "Langrisser Millenium" is divided into "Map Mode" and "Battle Mode".

Everything happens in real time: if you do nothing, the enemy will come and conquer your country. Once in battle mode, you control several teams. You only assign actions to the team leaders, while others fight automatically in round-based strategy combat.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</synopsis>

      <title>Meitantei Conan: Majutsushi no Chsenj!</title>
      <synopsis>Conan Edogawa is the pseudonym of Shin'ichi Kudo, but more than just a pseudonym, a pseudoform. Shin'ichi Kudo, an inquisitive seventeen year old student, was investigating a blackmail case when attacked by members of the Black Organization. He was forced to take an experimental APTX 4869 drug which caused, in a rare side-effect, his body to transform into that of a seven-year-old. 

This does not stop Shin'ichi, adopting the name Conan Edogawa he moves in with Ran Mori, his childhood friend and sweetheart. Enrolling in a elementary school to complete his disguise he vows to find out who is backing the Black Organization, and to have his revenge. With the help of his his oddball classmates, an ex-member of the Black Organization Ai Haibara, whose also been turned into a child, and his beloved he just might do it...

The games story follows the Conan through his school life which intertwines with his search for justice. He forms a Junior Detective League in his school to help him out. This cast of characters will help supply you information throughout the game.

The gameplay consists of using a map screen to travel to a number of areas collecting clues for the case you are on. Each area offers you the ability to examine the area, talk to bystanders, collect items, and sometimes attack if a threat is apparent. 

After collecting information you will have the chance to open your notebook, which will cause the WonderSwan to switch to a vertical orientation, and review your information. Also in the note books is a logic grid. On the grid you will have to select where you've deduced something intersects,who was at the scene at what time, by marking it with a circle and voiding all impossibilities with crosses. Once you've completed an entire grid you'll be able to present your deductions or press a point further allowing you to progress. If you've gotten your reasoning wrong, however, it is back to the drawing board and time to recheck you evidence and maybe time to see if you missed some clues.

This game includes five scenarios, roughly translated to English as:

1. Continuous high school girl kidnapping
2. Murder on the suspense drama set
3. Jack the Ripper murder
 
The mysteries incident's letter of notice
4. Treasure cases at the end of the century</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Detective Conan returns to the WonderSwans continuing his efforts to thwart the dreaded Black Organization. The game features new mysteries and new characters from the Conan universe. 

New features include finding keys. Keys represent actual bits of evidence you can use to solve the logic puzzles in the game once you find all the keys you will be able to attempt to solve the puzzle. However, often in the search for keys one finds hints. Hints are bits of information that will point you in the right direction of a key. Hints also be presented, singularly or combined, to various people in an attempt to extract information, or keys. Once you have all the keys you will be able to have an entire logic grid, otherwise there will be grayed out areas on the grid.

There is also now a mode in some cases where Conan will have to chase the suspect through several areas before subduing him. 

The game records your information at the start of the game to work a character based off of you into the game. This character can be swapped with other owners of 
Meitantei Conan: Nishi no Meitantei Saidai no Kiki !? through the Communication Cable.

This game alternates between horizontal display for regular play and investigation, and vertical display for Conan's detective notebook.</synopsis>

    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Mingle Magnet</title>
      <synopsis>Mingle Magnet is a simple puzzle game of the falling block variety. The player oversees a 10 x 10 square field where the first four rows (three on easy) have been filled by blocks. Each block shows one of three symbols, a dark gray circle, a light gray circle, and a white circle. When ever any of blocks with matching symbols touch they will form a link. By moving the cursor over a chain and clicking on it the player will be given points based on its size on the chain will be removed. The goal is to get a large score while making sure that new pieces can still enter the field. Once no more pieces can enter the game ends. Blocks fall at the same time one square apart, when the next set of blocks fall they will occupy the space given by the previous drop.

The "magnet" aspect of Mingle Magnet come into play in how the player can control the placement of the blocks. All the blocks are attracted to a magnet which, although not seen, can be placed on any side of the field. All blocks will be drawn to the magnet. For example, if one has the magnet at the south of the field and then puts it to the north what was the top of the block pile will now be the bottom, and blocks will fall onto what was the bottom. The direction of the magnet is indicated by a magnetic field animation behind the action.

This game is played vertically.</synopsis>

      <title>Nice On</title>
      <synopsis>A simple golf game; Nice On brings the gray-gradient green into the hands itinerant gamers. 

The mechanism for golfing in this game is simple as it is classic. The players chibi avatar stands by the tee club aloft whilst a 'power bar' fluctuates up and down beside it. When the player presses a button the power bars movements will stop and how height the bar was will effect the distance of the shot. Before this the player may of course state the direction they'd like to hit the ball and where on it's surface they would like to strike it. Hazards are or course a threat to the novice, such as sand traps, meddlesome trees, etc. The flight of the ball is shown in an overhead view.

Once the ball is on the putting green the view remains over head regardless if the ball is in motion or being struck. The player may here select the direction of the strike to the ball, and the power bar will recommence it's spasms; however, the golfer ball will move of its own accord without any golfer in sight. The putting green is covered by marks that indicate the subtle slopping of the ground that seeks to keep you away from your triple bogey. 

Should you find endlessly teeing off with yourself a bit tedious you may use the Communication Cable to play with another human, or you may challenge the npc character. This veritable samurai of the rough, swarthily attired in a fly fishing hat, will critique your game as he putts against you.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic is a digital conversion, with anime mascots, of the classic Japanese newspaper puzzle nonograms. A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; &amp;quot;5 9 4&amp;quot; would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. 

Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</synopsis>

      <title>Pocket Fighter</title>
      <synopsis>Pocket Fighter is a crossover fighting game that takes characters from the Street Fighter, Darkstalkers, and Red Earth fighting series, and presents them in a cute shrunken chibi form with ridiculous moves and costumes. The games fights take place in various Capcom locations.

At the top of the screen is your, and your opponents, health bar. Below that is a meter showing how many gems you've collected. Gems are produced from a character when they are hit by a kick or a punch, these gems will then lie on the ground until someone picks them up. Filling up your gem gauge will increase your special attack meters on the bottom of the screen. Ideally one aims to achieve a special attack level of 9 by picking up gems, however, battle will often having you using these up before you reach that lofty number.

The main difference between the Sega Saturn and PlayStation version of Pocket Fighter is a card battle mode. 

In the card battle mode you will be presented with a set of three to six cards to choose from to form an attack, after which you'll view the combat and get new cards to pick from until one player is K.O.'ed

The cards will have a attack power and a defense power. By combing cards you'll get an attack, defense, and counter value
which determine an overall power value. The player who has selected the higher power value will attack that turn, unless your foe has picked a guard card, an evasion card, or a high enough counter value. Other cards include recovery cards and special move cards.

"Collectible Cards", cards featuring various graphics of the game's characters, can be obtained by playing the games various modes, such as "Arcade", and traded via the Communication Cable

The game also featured an online high score board through the WonderGate.</synopsis>

      <title>Rainbow Islands: Putty's Party</title>
      <synopsis>A spin-off of the Rainbow Islands games, this title features Putty instead of the classic Bub &amp; Bob. Like the previous games set on the island the character's main tools and weapons are rainbows. These rainbows can be walked on to scale heights or cover gaps. Rainbows can also be used to kill enemies by striking them with the arc as it is created, or after it has taken form jumping on it so that it breaks and the shards rain death on those below. Enemies can also be trapped in rainbows. Enemies killed by rainbow shards will sometimes drop a special item or a gem. A series of gems are needed to properly clear each level.

The goal of each area, aside from collecting gems, is to scale to the top of the island. Islands are made out of a series of themed platforms covered with associated enemies. These areas are scattered with items, mostly food, that will increase your score. Sometimes a rainbow will dislodge hidden food or an enemy will drop some when killed. If your score is high enough you will start to  send out more than one rainbow at a time. At the end of each island there will be a boss. If you fulfilled certain requirements in the level you may get a special item.

The islands in this game are, here listed with their theme:

1. Insect Island: Insects and nature
2. Monster Island: Classic horror monsters
3. Doh Island: Geometric
4. Darius Island: Machines

This game plays vertically.</synopsis>

      <title>Sangokushi II for WonderSwan</title>
      <synopsis>Sangokushi II, or Romance of the Three Kingdoms II, is a video game based on the historical novel of the same name by Luo Guanzhong. It was developed and published by Koei in 2000 for the WonderSwan and is the sequel to the first game released in 1999.
Upon starting the game, players choose from one of six scenarios that determine the initial layout of power in ancient China. The scenarios loosely depict allegiances and territories controlled by the warlords as according to the novel, although gameplay does not follow events in the novel after the game begins. The player wins the game by conquering all territories in China. This is accomplished by being in control of every province on the map.</synopsis>

Au début de la partie, les joueurs choisissent entre six scénarios qui déterminent la répartition initiale du pouvoir dans la Chine ancienne. Les scénarios illustrent vaguement les allégeances et les territoires contrôlés par les chefs de guerre d'après le roman, bien que le jeu ne suive pas les évenements du roman après le début. Le joueur remporte la partie en conquérant tous les territoires de la Chine. Cela se fait en contrôlant toutes les provinces sur la carte.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>This is a portable edition of the solitaire game Shanghai, the game uses traditional Mah Jong tiles. The aim of the game is to match tiles, four of each type will be put on the playing field, when two tiles are matched they are removed when none remain you win. Only tiles that can be moved freely to the left or right may be matched. A wrong move may result in you not being able to clear the field. 

A slight story mode is presented in the Shanghai mode; each tile setup is based on a Zodiac animal that needs it power restored. The goal is to complete all twelve of these stages there by restoring the animals power. 

Some variants are also included:

1. Kong Kong: Compete against a computer to clear tiles. If you go slowly you will have tiles sent over to your by your opponent. This type of play is similar to games like Puyo Pop. Kong Kong may be played against another player by using a link cable or against a computer.

2. Challenge (WonderSwan only): A large Shanghai game that you'll try to race through to get the best score. 

3. Goldrush: In this mode you will race against an opponent to reach a tile marked 'G'. G is for GOLD, boy! So get cracking.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Straight from the National Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) come the greatest wrestlers of the Land of the Rising Sun; beware the Thunder Lyger!

Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling Toukon Retsuden is a simple wrestling game where the player takes control of one of six wrestlers, who were current figures at the time of the games publication. Random battles can be arranged or competition in a tournament against all the games wrestlers.

A player controls their wrestler with the directional X buttons and the A &amp;amp; B buttons. A &amp;amp; B perform punches and kicks, in close enough a punch can perform a grab. Once a wrestler is locked in a grab they can be tossed according to the directional buttons. The more abuse a character take the longer it will take them to stand up, this makes them very agreeable to kick or jump upon. 

By punching a fallen gladiator you will get him in a lock. When done closer to the injured legs you will usually try to bend them and when done closer to his head you will crush his cranium between your mighty thighs. If you can do this for ten seconds without him breaking free, your chosen wrestler will win.</synopsis>

The game also comes with modes for 2 players with two variants: 2P Pocket Game (the traditional mode) and 2P 9-Ball Game, where the premise is to sink 9 balls before the other player makes them first. If you prefer, test your target in Trick Game or even hear your favorite song in Jukebox.

After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!</synopsis>

      <title>Slither Link</title>
      <synopsis>Slither Link is a fiendishly simple puzzle game from the pages of the Nikoli puzzle magazine. While Nikoli is widely known for coining the puzzle name Sudoku they also have produced a myriad of puzzles often dealing with numbers. 

In this puzzle the player needs to create a loop around the fields grid with out having the loop's line cross itself. This would of course present little challenge if it weren't for those pesky numbers. The field is dotted with numerals that signal how many times the line may be next to it. The number one may only have the line contiguous with it on one side, the two two sides, the three three side. Four of course does not exist as that would, by a requirement to have four sides, create a square and thus a intersection of the line. Zeros also exist these may not have any lines bordering them at all. 

When a loop has been created so that all numbers are 'touched' appropriately and the line make a full loop you've cleared the puzzle. The game possesses six levels of difficulty and is played vertically on the WonderSwan.</synopsis>

The player controls a single one of their chosen team's members. The AI clumsily takes care of the rest. The player's selected splinter of the team avatar will move in the direction the player presses while dribbling the ball, should it be in his possession. When a button is pressed the ball will be kicked, should fortune spare your 2.49 inch screen a glance, to another player on your team. If another team member gets the ball you will automatically switch to that player. Kicking the ball is achieved by pressing a button which will more likely cause the player's character to fall on his face.

A penalty shot mini-game is included where the view shifts to behind the player making the shot.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A conversion of the classic arcade title, Space Invaders. This version, as part of the Arcade Classic series on Game Boy, has both 1 and 2 player modes using the usual 2 color Game Boy tones (black, grey) to re-create the addictive shooter. However, plug the cart into a Super Game Boy (an accessory of the Super Nintendo) and you have the option of playing the game in full color, with the original arcade cabinet as border art to the action while you play.

The game is very simple to play. Shoot down the incoming invaders while dodging their fire. They will advance slowly at first towards you, but the closer they come, the faster they get.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Tarepanda no Gunpey is a Gunpey style puzzler which has the modes of Gunpey EX with an additional Tarepanda story mode. 

The game includes classic Gunpey, endless Gunpey, a timed line removal mode, and a mode where the player must clear all lines at once. Two players can also link up to challenge each other and exchange high-scores. 

A story mode is also included. Tarepanda discovers the existence of other lazy pandas all around the world; wondering what other floppy pandas are like Tare rolls off in search of them.

Each panda wears headgear associated with its homeland, top hat for Britain, turban for India, etc. When our hero is about to reach the new lazy panda something gets in the way, usually an incline too large to roll over. By finishing a certain number of lines you'll give your stymied panda the energy to jump the obstacle. 

In the story mode a number of novel hazards are presented. Your lines may flip angles, or parts of the screen may be entirely blocked out.</synopsis>

      <title>Tekken Card Challenge</title>
      <synopsis>Fighting games are generally interested in making a player hit a complex mash of buttons to perform pugilistic wonders. This game is however card based, how can that work? During a battle between two opponents a set of five moves will appear on a roulette. The player hits a button to stop the rotation of the selector to semi-randomly select a field. A higher number card will always cancels out a lower number card. Higher number cards also do more damage. Block cards and counter cards also exist.

A number of different attacks are available: combo cards pile up, allowing multiple cards to be selected until a combo card is reselected or a non-combo card is selected; juggling cards which allow for classic fighting game mechanics by allowing another attack after the first; charge cards allow the player to wait a turn to do extra damage should the player use an attack the next turn.

All cards have different visuals, and oft times different names, for different characters. 

There are several game modes: a classic arcade battle where the player selects a character and a computer controlled character to face; an adventure mode where the player finds new cards and unlocks new character by defeating them; and a multiplayer vs. match for WonderSwan wielding humans.

The story mode plays on a 15x15 grid map covered with shrines, villages, and impassible mountains. You will only have a certain number of steps to make it to stage exit or you'll lose. Of course this Harshadic field is populated with a grave propensity of villains. Roving in the dark, for all the area of the world is obscured by 'fog' until the player walks there, are mysterious stormtroopers called Crow, Owl, Eagle. Also wandering the land are Tekken characters who hold long standing grudges against the player's character. Above it all in a high tower is the heinous Ogre, can he be defeated? 

Along the way cards can be found that will increase the amount of moves that can be performed in combat. Sacred ziggurats exist, two per map, that will heal wounds and, if enough enemies have been defeated since the last shrine, a new form of attack card be obtained. These shrines may not be reentered. 

Players may fight their friends or foes using the Communication Cable to connect two WonderSwans for a fight.</synopsis>

Each of the game's 17 levels plays like an episode with text interchanges and battles (fought both in space and on various planets) that alternate between tactical moves and short cutscenes to show the results. There are also 8 new scenarios plugged in to freshen up the story with new enemies such as a hotshot Gamilas commander to rival General Lysis, a space creature or two, and the Siren of Space?a game version of the little-known manga spinoff, Eternal Story of Jura.

      <synopsis>Umitsuri ni Ikou! is a simple fishing simulator where you control a little boy at a variety of seaside locations; a pier, a beach, a stone outcropping, and out on the ocean.

As you cast a bar will rise and fall on the right side of the screen, when you press the A button the the bar will stop. Depending on how high the bar is when you stop it correlates to how far your line goes. Bigger fish lurk farther out; however, bigger fish are more difficult to real in given their distance from shore.

One your hook is in the water you will be treated to a [fisheye?] view of it in the brine. The background water is represented in different gradients so that the player can tell if they are moving up and down. A meter on the right hand side of the screen shows how deep you are, the farther you cast the deeper you'll be. 

By pulling the line up with fish will be attracted to the hook. Should one grab on you'll get a "HIT". The view will now revert to being behind the fisher. Based on indications from a bar on the bottom you will have to push left and right, based on how the fish is trying to escape while pressing A. 

Once caught you'll learn how big your fish was and be able to exchange data about it with other WonderSwan players.</synopsis>

The story is told from the perspective of a woman, Kirie Goshima, who lived Kurôzu-Cho and now looks back to certain events that took place during here high school years. 

Shuichi Saito, her beloved, suggests they elope to a nearby city. Trying to find out why Shuichi is so sudden Kirie discovers that he suspects a curse. Kirie finds this hard to believe, so Shuichi brings up a grim family anecdote.

Shuichi's father began a spiral mania, collecting every thing with a spiral, ending with bizarre spiral self mutilation leading to his death. Shuichi's mother tried to purge herself or spirals, clipping off the skin of her finger prints. Ultimately dying from complications when she tries to gouge out her inner ear. 

A nervous Kirie goes back into her everyday school world but things seem strange... Spirals that are part of the mundane world suddenly take on a new threatening life. A whorl of hair, a jack in a box, a scar, a plate, metaphorical spirals, love, hate, madness lurks in Kurôzu-Cho

The game is essentially a black and white manga. During the story you will make choices for Kirie directing her through the mysterious events.

      <title>Wonder Stadium</title>
      <synopsis>Wonder Stadium, not to be confused with the near identical Wonder Stadium '99, presents a monochrome baseball experience for the WonderSwan. Players will quickly be able to start playing as one of fourteen teams, twelve professional two fictional, in All-Star Duel, Exhibition Game, or Homerun Competition modes. Player can also personalize their teams by giving the generic characters who comprise the teams names. 

When starting a game you'll be asked to select a team, a stadium; classic, seaside, or space, and how many innings the game will run from 1 to 9.

Hitting the ball is the 'simple' affair that it usually is, time your swing and if you timed well your ball will fly into or out of the field. Wonder Stadium does give the ability to bunt and tweak the direction that bunt will go. 

While playing the field you'll have considerable command over a number of different pitches. From moving your pitchers subtly around the mound to how hard a throw you'll give. Once your opposing team manages to get a hit the game stops giving you the view from behind the plate a switches to a birds-eye view of the field.

Each ballplayer is hooked to another for instance when you move your man on first base the fellow in the field behind him will move in the same way, a bit clumsy but an acceptable compromise. The person nearest the ball will always be under your control. Once you get the ball you may throw it toward a base of your choice.</synopsis>

      <title>wuzb? Produce: Street Dancer</title>
      <synopsis>Street Dancer is a rhythm game starring the crew of wuz?b? a Japanese pop music performance group. 

The game features standard with a line of button prompts scrolling across the bottom of the play are that you will have to press when they reach the center of the screen. Before you start a game you will be asked to select a member of the wuz?b? crew; Nana, Kaoru, Shino, or U. As you press buttons the chosen terpsichorean will shake it or stare at you in stupefaction, depending on your performance. A 'life bar' is presented on the screen if you fail to perform well the bar will go down, when it is empty your game ends. To clear a stage and unlock a new background with a harder song you'll have to get about a 60% perfect score. You can always record your performances to watch over and over.

When a stage is clear you unlock new dance moves, these dance moves will appear in the game and in the &amp;quot;Step Book&amp;quot;. In the step book you can watch the members of wuz?b? perform all their signature moves. You can also have the dancers perform in any way you like which you can record and repay for your friends. 

Three different musical styles are represented: jazz, hip hop, and rock. The game makes each of these modes unique, not just by changing musical tone but, by having the player change the way he holds the WonderSwan for each genre.

The forms are:

1. Hip hop: the screen is held in the normal horizontal position so that the left hand can hit the A+B buttons and right hand can press the basic directional keys.

2. Lockin' [sic]: In the mode the system is held so that both hands can press the directional buttons.This mode also requires you to press two notes at a time usually matching directions on both sets of directional buttons.

3. Jazz: This is a total reversal of the hip hop mode. The system will now be horizontal but essentially upside down. Now the directional keys and A+B buttons will be at the top of the console

A multiplayer mode is also included for two people on one system. both players take one set of the WonderSwans directional buttons and both players select different dancers. The multiplayer mode takes place in the vertical &amp;quot;lockin'&amp;quot; style, with two columns of press commands scrolling on the right. Both players are instructed by one of the columns, the player that is doing better will have their chosen dancer displayed on the screen.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>There are six nations living in the world of floating islands. The most powerful one is the Ordia Empire, possessing the best aircrafts in the world. But its leaders were hungry for even more power, and planned to invade and to occupy the other five nations. The other nations tried to maintain diplomatic relationship with the Empire as long as possible. But one of those countries, the Esk Republic, decided to send a special strike team of skillful pilots, attempting to initiate a secret rebellion against the Empire. A young pilot named Keid, guided by his senior partner, the girl Payer, is the one who was chosen for this mission.

      <title>Dicing Knight.</title>
      <synopsis>Dicing Knight. follows the journey of a nameless knight fighting through a series of randomly generated dungeons.  The game will start on the floor of a dungeon, your goal being to find the floors key to progress to the next floor. Eventually you will reach a dungeon boss, after you beat it youll be allowed access to a new more difficult dungeon. Dungeons are timed by a Food Gauge which when depleted will force you to exit the dungeon.

The dungeons are named:

1. Lindwurm - German term for dragon, meant to establish the mythic setting. This dungeon has a heavenly aura.
2. Shootingstar - A fiery land that will start to test your knowledge of the controls from Lindwurm.
3. Jabberwock - A whimsical land that is bathed in night. When the night shall end is unknown.
4. Quetzalcoatl - The area named for the Aztec sky god and creator. The entire map can no longer be seen.
5. Jörmungandr - The serpent that shall kill Thor. This stage is a mythic earthy setting.

The A button swings your sword and the B rings up your shield, the key items of any knight. Slashing your foes with your sword and devouring projectiles with your shield will increase your special meter, which when filled will allow you to perform a deadly special attack Shining Sword or "Blazing Sword".

One interesting features of Dicing Knight is the dicing every time you attack an enemy dice will pop out of it and roll, youll deal damage to the foe based on the rolls you get. Likewise when you are hit dice also roll to determine youre damaged. 

The Y buttons will be mapped to four different items, which can be found inside your foes. A variety of items are included in the game such as an item that will predict or alter dice rolls, a variety of stat altering potions, invincibility items,  and a drill that will let you progress through dungeon wall to avoid monster filled rooms. Various orbs are also obtainable, via a lottery system, which will improve your abilities. 

After you beat the game on Knight Mode youll obtain a, Fortuner Mode, which will alter the game play, keeping the dungeon crawling style but giving you the ability to shoot to you and more of the monsters. The A button will be transformed into a double pistol, and the B will lob grenades. As well as two new specials that allow you to absorb enemy bullets or do a powerful shock attack. A new stage with a fitting title will also appear:

1. Ouroboros - The snake eating its own tail, an alchemical symbol of immortality, this dungeon rests betwixt time, eternal, and waiting.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>This is a sequel to  Digimon Adventure 02: Tag Tamers, set in the world of digital monsters based on the popular manga series. After having defeated the evil Millenniumon, our hero Ryou thought that would be his last travel to the Digiworld.

      <synopsis>Digimon Battle Spirit is a fighting game originally published by Bandai and developed by Dimps for the Japanese-only WonderSwan Color handheld system under the name Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit. It was later ported to Nintendo's Game Boy Advance for international releases in North America and Europe two years later.

In response, several Digimon and their human companions have set out to stop Millenniummon and his minions before any irreparable harm can be done.

      <synopsis>Based on the popular Digimon manga, this is a sequel to  Digimon Adventure 02: D1 Tamers. The game picks up directly where the previous one ended. After yet another ultimate battle against the evil Millenniumon, during which he revealed to the hero Ryou a terrifying secret, there was a great explosion. Ryou comes to his senses in an unknown place. The only digital monster there explains to him that the explosion send Millenniumon to the future, while Ryou ended up in the past. And now Millenniumon is trying to take control over the main computer in the Digiworld, and it is Ryou's task to stop him once and for all, and to finally find the truth about his and his archenemy's identities.

The gameplay is similar to that of the predecessors: you navigate your hero over the top-down view, descend into dungeons, fight monsters in turn-based combat, recruit them into your party, and send the new teams to fight new enemies. The battle are not isometric any more, but viewed entirely as animé-style pictures. Attacks are also depicted as animated sequences.</synopsis>

      <title>Digimon Tamers: Digimon Medley</title>
      <synopsis>"Digimon Medley" is based on the popular manga and and animé series Digimon, in which ordinary Japanese children find a way into a digital world, where they help good digital monsters fight against evil ones. The game is not directly plot-related to  Digimon Adventure or Digimon Tamers: Brave Tamer games. Instead, it follows more closely the actual episodes of the series. You play as various characters, such as the main hero Taichi and his friend Yamato from the first episodes, as well as heroes from the Digimon Tamers sub-series: Takato, Ruki, and Lee. The game is divided into short episodes, each one of which revives one of the battles in the series. You start with Digimon Tamers, as they venture into the DigiWorld, only to meet the enigmatic digimon named Impmon, who is up to some mischief. 

Each episode can be played as one of several available characters. Each character also has his/her own digimon who fights all the battles. The battles are random and occur while you are navigating your heroes through top-down dungeons. The attacks are displayed as short animé-style sequences. During your turn, you must press the A button repeatedly to increase the power of your attack. The enemy attacks simultaneously, and you have to invest enough power in your attack in order for it to connect.</synopsis>

The game flows in real time, but you can interfere and perform various actions. The hamster has its own room in a house, with a table and a wheel. There are many things you can do with the hamster. You can take in to a stroll in the forest, go shopping with it, make it play with a ball, and so on. You can also perform actions unrelated to the hamster, like re-decorating the house or writing and painting on a piece of paper. The game features a point-and-click interface: you move your cursor over an object (such as hamster or calendar), which brings up an action menu.</synopsis>

      <title>Final Fantasy</title>
      <synopsis>Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy... the first of one of the longest role-playing game series known to mankind. Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all.

The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real journey begins...

Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters is entirely up to him. He also gives the characters names. 

In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system; the ATB (active-time battle) system from the later installments is not used. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run.) Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. 

Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up magic points, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.</synopsis>

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the  first and the  third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>After the long intro has set the plot the player is given control of Chopper who's initial aim is to return to the group after unfortunatley becoming lost in the wilderness. The standard action RPG features apply; enemies wander the landscape and you can choose to attack or ignore them. You can also use the 'defend' button to reduce the damage inflicted by an unexpected attack.

The music and graphics are a great improvement on the functional appearence of the previous games and in many ways Chopper no Daibouken is far more entertaining but it requires a lot more Japanese knowledge than the straight forward, menu driven, Treasure Wars titles.</synopsis>

      <title>From TV Animation One Piece - Grand Battle Swan Co</title>
      <synopsis>Ever wondered which One Piece character is the toughest? Could Zoro take Sanji in a fight? Well this game is probably the closest you'll get to an answer. Modes include Story, 1P Vs Com and 1P Vs 2P.

A real high point in the WonderSwan One Piece series in terms of presentation and graphics, Swan Colosseum gives the player a choice of six characters with which to dish out the pain to the opposition. Play as all the key characters: Luffy, Chopper, Sanji, Usopp, Nami and Zoro and face each in turn as well as other series key players in one round matches.

Swan Colosseum offers some refreshingly different gameplay from the usual 'Street Fighter 2' clones. There's more of a 'Power Stone' vibe to this with each stage being fairly large and allowing the player to explore platforms and acquire weapons and items from randomly placed crates and barrels.

The controls are quite different to what you might have come to expect from a one-on-one beat-em-up too. The player only uses two buttons to play; I to attack and II to jump (twice for double jump). This leaves the D-pad to dictate the kind of attack corresponding to the direction pressed or to block by holding 'down'. This method works well for the exploration elements of the gameplay but seriously limits the range of moves. Aside from the character specific special attack, unleashed by filling the power bar and a secret button combo, each of the cast really only has one attack simply with directional variants. This also does nothing to help the weaker members like Usopp &amp; Chopper especially the later who is already handicapped by his lack of stature. </synopsis>

      <synopsis>An action board game reminiscent of the Famicom Dragonball Z titles. Choose your character then make your way around the location a square at a time according to the role of a dice. The goal is to be the player who retrieves the lost piece of treasure for that stage.

Behind many of the squares that make up the game world hide actions and events. The most common is the battle event that pits your character against the nearest opponent.

Despite being a 'Party Game' Treasure Wars does have a story to it. It may be fairly light but it's better than nothing. The SD graphics look good and sum up the overall style of the game. As always the WonderSwan's limited musical accompaniments make the best of what they've got.

As for gripes, well the choice of gameplay may not be to everyone's taste and in single player it can take what feels like forever to get through the COM's three turns and back to yours. </synopsis>

      <synopsis>Almost exactly the same as it's predessor. Different plot and slightly improved graphics but otherwise little to diferentiate gameplay-wise.

That's not to say Treasure Wars 2 is any less enjoyable just little changed; still "choose your character and attempt to reach the treasure/defeat the boss before one of the other COM characters beat you to it".

As before the number of game squares you move is controlled by a role of the dice and,as before, it seems like for ever for your turn to come around again.

More fun played in 'Party Mode' with friends than in single player and you needn't worry too much about the Japanese text as it's fairly easy to work out. </synopsis>

      <title>Front Mission</title>
      <synopsis>In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the &amp;quot;Larcus Incident&amp;quot; and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed &amp;quot;Carrion Crow&amp;quot;. Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</synopsis>

      <title>Guilty Gear Petit</title>
      <synopsis>The game takes place in 22th century. Scientists developed a new technique that allowed them to merge the DNA of humans and animals, producing powerful creatures known as "gears". The characters of the game participate in a tournament, the winner of which would face a gear who went out of control and is threatening to lead a gear rebellion against the humans. The game allows you to play as familiar characters from Guilty Gear series, such as the main hero Sol Badguy, who has a certain connection to the gears, and his rival, the leader of the Holy Knights named Ky Kiske. It also introduces a new character, the nurse Fanny, who fights with a syringe and has a mysterious connection to the genius surgeon, and later serial murderer, Dr. Baldhead. 

"Guilty Gear Petit" is a 2D fighting game. The story mode lets you pick a character and take him/her through a series of fights, while in time attack mode you can choose your opponents freely. The graphics are done in "super-deformed" style. The game retains key ingredients of Guilty Gear gameplay, such as building tension in order to execute powerful attacks, combo moves, etc.</synopsis>

      <title>Guilty Gear Petit 2</title>
      <synopsis>In 22th century, scientists found a way to create artificial beings whom they called "gears". These gears were very powerful, but did not have wills of their own, and were completely obedient to the humans. However, a gear named Justice was able to free himself from the control and led a rebellion against the humans. Since then, the humanity lived in fear that the gears will one day gain the power on the Earth. For that purpose, the Sacred Order of the Holy Knights organized fighting tournaments to find out who is strong enough to face the renegade gears.

"Guilty Gear Petit 2" is very similar to its  predecessor, having the same "super-deformed" graphical style, battle moves (including the tension system to accumulate power and combo attacks), as well as backgrounds for battles. Several new characters appear in "Guilty Gear Petit 2", such as Zato-1, the former head of the assassin guild, the pirate captain Johnny, the time traveler Axl Lou from the 20th century, the mysterious Faust, and others.</synopsis>

      <title>Gunpey EX</title>
      <synopsis>Direct sequel to the original Gunpey on the WonderSwan, Gunpey EX adds a number of new elements to the classic; most notably, color.

In addition to earning points for completing a line across the field you will now earn points if those lines are of a matching color. Previously only gray lines were possible now red, blue, and green lines appear.

Gunpey EX has the same modes as the previous game, except a story mode. Time Attack mode where one has to eliminate as many tiles as possible in two of five minutes. Endless mode give the player unlimited time to crank out whatever score they desire. Stage mode presents a set number of tiles to remove in a given time. Puzzle mode puts the player in the situation of having to remove a certain group of tiles, the player can change the color of the lines here when they swap their tiles positions.

A link mode is available to play against another human with a WonderSwan and Gunpey EX. 

This game could access the internet through a wireless phone and the WonderGate where it was able to interact with an online high score board.</synopsis>

      <title>Hanjuku Eiy - Aa Sekai Yo Hanjuku Nare</title>
      <synopsis>Hanjuku Eiyu is set in a semi-comical universe called the Egg World, populated by two nations: Hanjuku and Kanjuku, or soft-boiled and hard-boiled eggs, respectively. You take the role of the commander of the Hanjuku army, and your goal is to guide it successfully through a series of events (called "tales"), capturing enemy castles and defeating the bosses of the Kanjuku army. 

This is a real-time war strategy game. The game time is divided into months, each month taking a few minutes of real time. You control the hero and his generals, each one commanding units of foot soldiers. You send your army commanders through the world map to capture enemy castles. Once all the castles are captured, a new construction appears on the map, where the level boss resides, and your final goal in the chapter (tale) is to defeat this boss. Once you run into an enemy, an automatic battle sequence occurs, which you can interrupt, assigning commands to your army. Both Hanjuku and Kanjuku armies can summon powerful creatures called Egg Monsters, who can fight against a whole army or against each other in turn-based combat. Each month a "monthly event" occurs, such as changes in the land, earthquake, etc. Random events also pop out, during which you can buy supplies for your army.</synopsis>

      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>Inuyasha is one of those hard to find shows that manage to perfectly blend awesome fighting with romantic drama. This is probably why it's one of my favorite animes out there. Like many animes of this type, there is one broad-scale plot to the series; yet it's played out so most of the episodes have their own little unique story, separate from the main plot. No doubt this makes it easy to make an Inuyasha game, because there is so much story to work with. Although it would be impossible to cover everything in the series in a single WonderSwan Color game, Inuyasha is still pretty good in length.

A young girl named Kagome lives in an old shrine with her family in modern-day Japan. While out near an old well, a pair of huge arms grabs her and pulls her down the well. When she comes to, she is in feudal Japan. She looks up and sees Inuyasha, unconscious and stuck on a tree with an arrow. The next thing she knows, a giant, nasty looking centipede shows up and demands she hands over the shikon jewel. Kagome doesn't know what it's talking about, and at this Inuyasha wakes up.

Long story short, Inuyasha convinces her to free him, he kills the demon and tries to take the jewel for himself, and after some happenings the jewel is broken into a million pieces. It turns out Inuyasha was stuck to a tree because of an evil demon named Naraku, who also wants the jewel for himself. Inuyasha and Kagome go out in search for the jewel shards, meet up and join with more people Naraku has made suffer. The game itself covers mostly the story and fights involved with Naraku and his minions.

Pretty good sound for a WSC game. Several of the sound effects are right out of the show itself. Most of these are Inuyasha's various battle noises and attacks, such as Demon Claws, Kizan, and the standard punching noises. Occasionally we hear the voice of Inuyasha or Kagome, and those too are right out of the show. The various menu beeps and low-toned and very non-abrasive.

One thing I really like about this anime is the excellent music. While the game doesn't feature all of the great music, it features the main series theme and the main battle theme. The rest of the music is made up for this game, but it all fits the mood and what is happening very well, so I have no problem with any of it.

The WonderSwan has a really annoying physical set up of its buttons. Thankfully, Inuyasha only uses the basic ones; A, B, and the "directional letters" (W, X, Y, and Z as opposed to up, down, left, and right). Since all the fighting is turn and menu-based, the controls stay simple and easy.

I've never been very impressed with WSC's graphics capabilities. The graphics in this one, though, are pretty good. The adventure view sprites are pretty disproportionate with smudged colors, while the battle sprites are very clear and detailed. Whenever a character speaks, they have a little picture next to their text. They all look more-or-less like they should (except for Sango, who's picture is totally off). The levels look really good and detailed as well.

Inuyasha is called an adventure game. I've never seen an adventure game that has so much story and so little fighting and action. I'm not the least bit surprised, because that's pretty much how the series goes. At times there are stretches of several episodes where it's almost all fighting and action, then we get several episode that concentrate on the plot. The game is mostly talk, cut scene, talk, move somewhere else, fight, talk, move somewhere else, fight, rinse and repeat. While this would seem like it can get tedious and boring, you get through to the fighting rather quickly when you don't (or can't) read the text. The fights themselves are pretty fun.</synopsis>

      <title>Judgement Silversword - Rebirth Edition</title>
      <synopsis>In your space fighter, the S-AIXAK, you'll be going up against the minions of the Judgement Silversword. Starting from a small space station above the earth your lone fighter will travail the bullet filled cosmos, always a shot away from death, to achieve this goal.

Judgement Silversword is a vertically scrolling shooter in which wave upon wave of multifarious of opposing craft will try to take you down with bullets, bombs, lasers, or even their own fuselages. Using the Y-Buttons as a directional pad and the X-Buttons for your weaponry you'll try your hand at completing the S-AIXAKs destiny.

You'll have three weapons at your disposal, spread cannon, concentrated cannon, and your energy shield. The spread cannon will fire an arch of bullet out before you, while a concentrated will fire only directly before you. Your energy shield can be used to absorb incoming shot, however, your back and sides will remain vulnerable. The shield can also be used to damage enemies by ramming them with it. As you use it the shield will run out of energy and need to be recharged. 

The game has thirty different areas each comprised of about ten sub areas. Scores are awarded based on kill ratio and completion time. New modes and easter eggs will be unlocked as you obtain higher scores.</synopsis>

      <title>Kinnikuman IIsei - Choujin Seisenshi</title>
      <genre>Fighting</genre>
      <synopsis>Kinnikuman Second Generation: Choujin Seisenshi is based on the Japanese anime Kinnikuman (literally "Muscle Man"). Originally created as a parody of Ultraman, Kinnikuman was a clumsy goof of a superhero whose services were only called upon to battle monsters if no other superheroes were around.

Kinnikuman's powers came from eating garlic, which would gradually fill the "garlic meter" on his forehead until he could grow into a giant to fight the monsters. His main attack was the "Kinniku Flash" beam.

As Kinnikuman developed, it began focusing exclusively on professional wrestling in which Kinnikuman would wrestle ridiculous parodies of popular Japanese superheroes and their adversaries, including "The Toilet Paper Mummy," a giant hand, and monsters based on things like pachinko machines and telephones. The heroes and villains of Kinnikuman were collectively referred to as "Chōjin," which literally translates to "Supermen." The majority of the characters were made by fans who sent in chōjin character designs or ideas and were then incorporated into the story in various major and minor roles. Notable examples of main characters created in this manner include Warsman and Brocken Jr.

The story involves Kinnikuman (his real name is Suguru Kinniku), a clumsy fool of a superhero, finding out he is the missing prince of the planet Kinniku, known for turning out the greatest superheroes in the universe. Being a clumsy fool, however, he must prove himself worthy of the throne. To do so, he enters into wrestling competitions and battles evil Chojin, ultimately culminating in a tournament between Kinnikuman and five pretenders to the throne (Kinnikuman Big Body, Soldier, Zebra, Mariposa, and Super Phoenix). Many of Kinnikuman's allies begin as villains (Ramenman, Buffalo Man, Ashuraman, Warsman), and extremely arrogant heroes (Terryman, Robin Mask, Rikishiman).

This game is a turn based wrestling simulation, where you choose your moves (in a random slot machine style) and watch the turn play out.</synopsis>

      <title>Namco Super Wars</title>
      <synopsis>Namco Super Wars is a tactical role-playing game developed by Namco and published by Bandai for the Wonderswan Color. It is a crossover game, featuring characters from several classic Namco titles.

The game is played on a square grid, on which both the player's and computer's units are placed. Each side takes turns moving and making actions with their units. Every character has a variety of attacks and special moves that can be selected when performing an action. Some of these consume Spirit Points, which slowly regenerate each turn. The game is divided into stages. Between each stage, the player is able to visit a shop and prepare his units before starting the next stage. Unlike most RPGs, characters do not gain levels for directly defeating opponents. Instead, completion of a map will reward the players with a number of level ups, which they can then distribute among their units as they wish.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Another Naruto game? Hum, appears that these days they grow on trees! Once you first get in touch with this game you can quite easily see that it is an RPG, but not a normal one, as it has some details which turn out to be quite interesting... 
During the game you will be able to play as Naruto, Konohamaru and all the others, even if only for a small time. Plus, in almost all the areas you will be playing, you may notice a yellow arrow... those are the exits to the place you are currently in, which turn to be quite useful as the scenario is so well done that perhaps you could have trouble in finding the exit. Also, in the world map most of the times you will notice a flashing location, which most of the times will be the place where you need to head next. Finally, concerning the battles... There is an attacking phase, where you can pick your attacks from a card-like interface, it's not very easy to explain this without seeing it, but you have some balls which represent the number of attacks you can do on that phase, and if you have more than 1 you can combine your "cards" in order to make a more powerful attack (or maybe not so powerful, because once I used 3 cards for making a damage of 24, while my "normal" attack makes more than 80...) As for the defensive phase, you can pick one of the cards you have left in order to perform an special defensive skill, which may vary from nothing up to a strange thing where your character is replaced by a trunk of a tree. You can't change these "cards", they are added to your skills as you learn them in the story. For example, when Naruto first uses the skill in which he turns into a whole bunch of girls, you will learn a "card" which lets you make clones of yourself, in battle, which can also fight for you. I must say  that they aren't really cards, but it is the best way to explain the battle interface...

The graphics on this game are really good, as you can clearly see the characters and instantly recognise them, if you are familiar with the series. There are even the faces of the characters in the game, while they are speaking with each other, but only if they are important characters. As for the sound, I guess I can say that it is great, it fits perfectly in the game.

As most of the battles are hard, you will have an hard time finishing the game. Well, you don't need to win all the battles, but once you win one, you receive bonus stuff, mainly improving the strength of your character... </synopsis>

      <synopsis>You play as the rhyme rider Kerorcian, a vivacious space girl with a large frog helmet, as she skips to the music through the games four stages. The games music is largely comprised of jazzy techno pieces.

Kerorcian skips down a set line while randomly placed enemies and obstacles appear before her. Various button combos will avoid certain obstacles, although a "one-button" easy mode is available. When you avoid an obstacle a note will sound, clearing long chains of obstacles will result in funky melodies popping up inside the song that is playing. This gameplay is reminiscent of the studios earlier game Vib Ribbon.  

Some of the obstacles are interactive, such as a rocket one can jump on and ride a short distance, others can merely be kicked out of the way or jumped over.

Occasionally a crown will appear over an obstacle, if you successfully clear it you will briefly soar over the stage avoiding anything that might have been in your path. This is especially common before obstacles that might require outlandish button combos.</synopsis>

However, it also incorporates a "dating sim" as a subplot where your character must win affection of another character.

It has similarities to Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, Golden Sun and a number of others. Reaching high levels is important to make the game not too difficult at the end. The levelling up is similar to Secret of Mana, where the weapon skill for a character increases at a different rate to the character levels.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A new netbattling tournament has opened for the world known as the Battle Chip GP. Yai is sponsoring the event while the others enter it. Even Chaud enters the tournament, but only for official business. It turns out that there is some type of new organization behind the scenes of the tournament who will delete the winning navi and take its data for themselves. Will Lan and friends be able to stop whoever is behind these threats?

This game utilizes a different battle system, in which you set up a "Program deck" of 12 chips and the game selects three chips at random from it and your Navi uses them consecutively, followed with their special attack. (If you are MegaMan you use the Charge Shot, and if you are Gutsman you will use the GutsHammer) Battles progress completely autonomously for upwards of five minutes while the player watches for results. Another interesting aspect is the ability to destroy your opponents Battlechips. Certain types of attacks not only do damage to your opponent, but to their ProgramDeck as well (each chip has a set amount of HP). You can win fights not only by utilizing power, but by deleting your opponents entire deck, making them unable to fight.

You can play as six different characters in this game including Lan and Megaman, Dex and Gutsman, Mayl and Roll, and Chaud and Protoman. There are also two others: Kai and Turboman and Mary and Ring. The popular Netnavi Bass can also be unlockable for play.

There is also an "Open Battle" feature on the game that allows you to select a certain area with a set amount of consecutive battles to fight. Every fifth battle in one of these you receive a new Navi Chip to use as well as a variable amount of Zenny.

The WonderSwan Color version is somewhat more condensed compared to the GameBoy Advance version, having much fewer battlechips to collect and less frames of animation for attacks.</synopsis>

      <title>Rockman EXE WS</title>
      <genre>Action,Platformer</genre>
      <synopsis>With the success of the Megaman Battle Network series (or Rockman.EXE, as known in Japan) for GameBoy Advance, some spin-offs were bound to appear sooner or later. The franchise was lent to Bandai so that they could also revel on its popularity and, instead of the style already so abused by Capcom on the GBA, they came up with a creative platformer. Despite sharing the same core of the classic Megaman games, it plays a bit different, obviously borrowing a lot from the Battle Network universe (specially the anime show).

The gameplay of this game is actually quite good. The levels play just like the old games, however they're shorter in general; you proceed through a 2D environment killing enemies and jumping from here to there, until you get to the boss. The great difference here is the insertion of the Network games ideas. Instead of changing weapons, like in the classic games, you get to use battlechips, which you can acquire throughout the levels killing enemies or searching in (not so much) hidden places.

Since there are no weapons, you may figure out you have nothing to absorb from the bosses once you kill them. You really don't, but when you get to defeat specific ones, you'll instead be awarded with a "style change", which will grant you a new armor with its own inherent strengths and weaknesses. It feels kinda like changing armors on Megaman X 5 and above, only though it can be done anytime you wish here.

One letdown point is the lack of an "overworld." Unlike your usual Megaman platformer, this game is pretty straight-forward, since you don't get to choose which level you'll go next. Most of the levels themselves have a midway path-split though, where you get to decide which sub-level you're going to explore. You can not go back on the levels, so if you miss something out you have to finish the game and then start again (it will keep in record what you've discovered so far) which gets kinda annoying.

So the gameplay ideas are not bad, actually, and it makes you feel this game could've been better with some more polishing. The interesting part about using battlechips is that you can equip some of them as your main attack, instead of simply "using them up". This can be done to swords, punches or hamming dashes. Wielding a sword is quite nice, giving that Megaman X 6 feel to Megaman. They even remembered to include "Program Advances", so you can actually mix some chips and get a stronger attack. The real problem with the battlechips, though, is their lack of usefulness. You'll most likely stick either to a sword or the ordinary buster of whatever armor/style you're wearing for almost the entirety of the game. 

The controls are partially responsible for this...  Bad is a fitting word to use here. And not because it's insanely difficult, but mostly because it lacks challenge where it's needed and delivers it where it shouldn't: the controls. The battlechip idea was a cool one, but like I said, most battlechips besides the sword are ignorable. Firstly because most of them are pretty ineffective and, second, the chips are assigned to the Y-buttons. Since you control Megaman using the X-buttons, you may figure it's quite a hassle to be able to quickly use any chip throughout the game, moving your thumb away from the X-buttons to do so. That accounts for the death of the whole battlechip idea, really.

In the other hand, the levels' layouts are modeled really weakly. They're all simple, short, and the most of challenge you're getting from them is provided by our old fellas, the pits, spikes or vanishing blocks (remember them, from Iceman's stage on the original Megaman and so many other stages afterwards?). And even those aren't as hard as they have been in the past. I must give this game one thing though, the boss battles are fun, and challenging enough despite the fact they have really short and fixed patterns of attack.

Another thing that could've been improved a bit are the "secrets". The game tracks down your total percentage of areas explored throughout all your plays, and that could account for an interesting map-hunting, trying to search hidden areas and the like. However, all of the few "secrets" are blatant, and Netto/Lan for the most time even hints them to Megaman. No challenge here, either.

The graphics show nothing to complain about, but they simply "work", not making the game nicer. It's cool they used Megaman intro animation from Megaman 8, though not all animations are good: there are plenty which seem kinda awkward, like Megaman's walking. The levels don't have elaborate backgrounds, and the foregrounds are actually worse, seeming rather dull and done with a certain lack of concern. The bosses, I guess, got the most of attention since they kinda stand out from the rest of the game - most enemies are bland, but the bosses are more vivid and display smoother animations.

Something that could've improved the game's presentation would be the addition of sceneries to the dialogue scenes. Most of the plot, which is taken straight from the anime, is developed on uninteresting screens with character portraits and plain text.

The sound effects and music used were not numerous, but they served their purpose. Nothing that makes the game stand out for any reason, so I guess I don't have much to comment on here. Some tunes were quite nice, with some classic Megaman feel to them, but not near to memorable. It beats me why the main theme from the cartoon or the GameBoy games wasn't included...

While this game does hold some replay value, it's not enough to make you stick for more than a couple days. You see, it's interesting that most levels have split paths, and you can't explore all areas of the game and achieve 100% completion in a single run through. However, finishing the game is an increasingly easy task since, when you finish, you're taken again to the start but granted all the power-ups you've acquired so far. That's a nice thing, actually, but can't save the fact this game is really short.

After you've explored the whole of each level, a new mode opens up on the main menu, featuring an endurance match against all bosses of the game. This is a cool thing since the boss battles are the most entertaining part of the game (and here you can even pick a difficulty level!), but I guess it wasn't interesting enough to get my attention for much longer. Perhaps beating this in the hardest level would reveal even more secrets, but I didn't care to find.</synopsis>

      <title>Romancing SaGa</title>
      <synopsis>Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.

Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.

"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"</synopsis>

      <title>Saint Seiya - Ougon Densetsu Hen - Perfect Edition</title>
      <genre>Role-Playing</genre>
      <synopsis>As you may imagine, this game is based on a world-famous anime series called Saint Seiya, but this was the first game released concerning this series for a long time, ever since the NES times no other games were released. So, if you liked the series, should you play this game?

Most of the times you will be controlling Seiya, the main character from the series, who is the Pegasus Saint. On the menu you can acess while exploring, you will be able to change your stats, "teleport" to another place, choose if you want to have your armor on or not and see the password which lets you continue playing later.  Also, you will be controlling Seiya in the levels, while punching the some bad guys until you find other powerful Saints. Then, the game will turn into an RPG-like battle in which you will need to fill 4 bars using your cosmo (an energy-like stat) and then strike using those stats that you increased in the turn before, making you able to strike the opponent with a strong punch, a weak blow or even your characters' special move. Yep, you can control more than Seiya, but only in the battles. All this means that most of the times you will be fighting bad guys to get more EXP Points (to raise your stats permanently) and for getting more Cosmo (which lets you make better attacks and raise your life points), which tends to be boring sometimes. And one thing must be said: Although most people say that this game is based on the game released on the NES console many years ago, this isn't *completely* true, since many things were changed.

This game is based on the story of the Saint Seiya anime, from the beggining of it up to the ending of the Sanctuary Chapter, but some of the minor events were left out of the game. The graphics are really nice, although the special moves of the characters aren't very well drawn. As for the sound, it isn't bad but it isn't good either, but as usual you can just turn it off.

Unfortunately, if you like this series you will be able to finish it in a couple hours, and once you finish it you will only put it away since it doesn't appear to have any replay value at all.</synopsis>

      <title>SD Gundam G-Generation - Gather Beat 2</title>
      <genre>Strategy</genre>
      <synopsis>Gather Beat is one of the best games for the Wonder Swan Color. It takes on average 24hrs to complete the game on normal, but there are different paths to choose (eg. You can go the Gundam W way and follow the Gundam W story, or you can go the Gundam G way and follow that story). There are multiple events - it depends on what character on your side attacks a certain character on a opposing side, and if your character is friends with an enemy they can convince them to join you.)

There are most of the suits from all the series' and lots of suits custom to Gather Beat 2. You can capture enemy suits and you can get favorites like Wing Zero, and my favorite the ZZ Gundam.

This game is like Super Robot Wars Compact. The battles are computer controlled (you tell what move to use and determine accuracy and damage by skill/weakness of opponent and ID comands your pilot has) you just watch animation. The only slight draw back is that there aren't objectives - you only kill all enemies (except for about three missions).

Missions take place in space, a side, or on Earth. The missions are based mostly on the show (like when Tres gives the five Gundams false orders to lure them together.) There are new ones and some things that won't happen in any of the shows (like OZ teaming with the ZION).

The game has customizable suits you can upgrade into another suit with parts, which is fun to find out if a part works on a certain suit to get something you haven't seen. Some suits get old like all the freakin Zaku's in the beginning but after awhile there are more. You can get almost every suit in the game (except for suits like Shar's Zaku) and some suits can only be made not found. So even if you beat it you still got to find a way to get all the suits. And Normal and Special modes allow you to get different suits, if you choose a different path you can get diff suits, or if you train after you beat it you can different suits, the possibilities are limitless.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Manta Oyamada, a shrimpy, studious middle-school student from Tokyo, attempts a shortcut one night through the graveyard to get home after a late night of cram school. While traveling through it, he encounters Yoh Asakura and his "companions": a graveyard filled with ghosts. Yoh reveals himself to be a shaman, a medium between the worlds of the living and the worlds of the dead. Yoh also demonstrates Shamans' ability to unite with ghosts to achieve a shared goal. Over the first few chapters, Yoh and Manta become best friends while Yoh uses his shamanic abilities to help them out through various normal tasks.

Yoh soon encounters Ren Tao, a Chinese shaman, and his ghost Bason. Ren is on a quest to destroy humanity as well as prepare for the upcoming "Shaman Fight" being held in Tokyo. The Shaman Fight is a battle held once every 500 years between competing shamans to choose a winner who will become the highly sought-after "Shaman King," one who is able to contact the Great Spirit (the spirit that every soul will eventually go back to). The winner gains the ability to reshape the world in any way they want. Anna Kyoyama, Yoh's fiancée, soon enters the picture and prescribes a brutal training regimen, in order to prepare Yoh for the tournament. Thus begins the plot that will lead Yoh on a journey that will lead him to many friends and adventures.

Through a series of events and also through participation in the Shaman Fight, Yoh meets and befriends numerous characters and changes their lives through friendship and authentic concern, which seems to be a pervasive theme throughout the series. Yoh must also face his ultimate destiny, connected to one of the most powerful participants in the Shaman Fight who desires to win the fight and annihilate all of humanity for destroying the world, leaving only a world of shamans such as himself.</synopsis>

      <title>The Final Fantasy Legend</title>
      <synopsis>The first 'Final Fantasy' title on the Game Boy, Legend allows you to choose from 8 different characters, from the usual human male or female to zombie, wererat, redbull (not the drink), clipper or mutant male or female. No matter which you choose, the goal stays the same: Increase your experience points and abilities by defeating many varied enemies through-out the land.

Much like the FF series of old (and new), you can choose members to join your party and the quest that lies ahead (either warriors, mutants or creatures). Every character has a limit to the amount of moves available during every battle and experience points are gained after each fight, increasing stamina, power, etc.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Uchuu Senkan Yamato is a Strategy game, developed by Tom Create and published by Bandai Visual in Japan in 2001.
Each of the game's 17 levels plays like an episode with text interchanges and battles (fought both in space and on various planets) that alternate between tactical moves and short cutscenes to show the results. There are also 8 new scenarios plugged in to freshen up the story with new enemies such as a hotshot Gamilas commander to rival General Lysis, a space creature or two, and the Siren of Space?a game version of the little-known manga spinoff, Eternal Story of Jura. Depending on performance and points earned, multiple endings are possible including one that incorporates the ?hologram Starsha' scene from the Yamato movie.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Although made by  Square, the famous Japanese RPG developer, "Wild Card" is a game that is very different from classic Asian RPGs. Most importantly, it is not story-driven. The game is based entirely on quests which are not connected by a story arc. You play a nameless character with no background and there is no plot information or development beside your own progress with the quests. The gameplay consists entirely of playing cards. In the beginning of the game, an enigmatic woman named Maria asks you a series of questions, to determine the cards you get. After that, your character begins an adventure in a town. Locations, other characters, inventory, your movement - everything appears in form of cards. To get quests, you must choose your correspondent cards when encountering different people. You can buy weapons and equipment, and also fight enemies in turn-based combat by choosing the cards from your deck. You gain levels and become stronger in a traditional RPG fashion.</synopsis>

Long time ago, a man and a woman made a promise, stating that although they were destined to be lonely souls, they should always remain together. But by a cruel joke of fate, they were separated and sealed into two jewels that were hidden for generations. Manami, who left the country 6 years before, has found one of the jewels while traveling. He will return to Japan to meet with their friends from childhood. This will entail a meeting of the two jewels again, for the second jewel seems to be owned by his father.</synopsis>
