      <title>4th Unit 2, The</title>
      <synopsis>One day a mysterious spaceship was sighted above Japan. Suspecting an alien invasion, the authorities ordered to shoot it down. However, to everyone's astonishment, the aircraft turned out to be completely unmanned and abandoned. Shortly thereafter, a teenage girl was found in the nearby forest. She doesn't remember anything except her name, Blon-Win, but apparently there is a connection between her and the strange aircraft. Blon-Win eventually finds out that she possesses unique powers, and joins the 4th Unit, a team of bionic soldiers who combat crime.

The 4th Unit is a Japanese-style adventure game. The emphasis is on advancing the story by triggering events rather than puzzle-solving. The list of commands, however, is fairly long, and includes (beside the standard "Examine", "Talk", and "Go") also verbs for taking objects, using items, affirmative and negative responses during certain dialogues, as well as the unique commands "Fight" and "Rescue". Each of these commands can be combined with a person or an object displayed on-screen by highlighting it. 

At certain points during the story Blon-Win and her allies will have to fight enemies. The fights are turn-based and consist of simple menu-based choices of attacks such as punching, kicking, etc. </synopsis>

      <title>4th Unit Act. 3, The - Dual Targets</title>
      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>Three months have passed since the destruction of the oceanic base of the criminal organization WWWF. One day, Blon-Win and Asshu spot an android assassin attempting to infiltrate the Unified Force base. It appears that the androids, controlled by the WWWF, intend to kidnap the scientist responsible for the revolutionary device known as PPB (Psycho Power Booster). In addition, they have developed a bionic soldier who is a clone of Blon-Win. As if this weren't enough, Blon-Win's old nemesis Dalzy appears on the stage as well...&#13;

Dual Targets is the third entry in the 4th Unit series and a direct sequel to The 4th Unit 2. The game retains the simple sporadic turn-based battles of the predecessors. However, the core adventure gameplay has been radically simplified and modified to resemble a visual novel. There is no direct interaction with the environment; instead, the player is prompted to select emotional responses ("happy", "angry", etc.) during dialogue, as well as alternate between "Rescue", "Think", and "Fight" commands during the storyline. These choices may influence the plot and lead the game to different endings, most of which are considered "false".</synopsis>

      <title>4th Unit Act. 4, The - Zero</title>
      <genre>Adventure</genre>
      <synopsis>Zerø is the fourth entry in the 4th Unit series and a direct sequel to Dual Targets. Only a few days have passed since the andoird assaults and the shocking encounter with Blon-Win's clone. The Unified Force gathers all its resources, preparing to engage the shady trade organization WWWF. However, a strange accident leads Blon-Win to assume that one of the Unified Force's members might be a traitor.
&#13;
Gameplay-wise, Zerø returns to the Japanese adventure format of the first two entries, abandoning the visual novel style of its immediate predecessor. However, it still retains the emotional response system (only three out of five are present: "nice", "angry", and "sad"), which is sometimes needed to steer conversation. Topics are fixed for all dialogues. Much of the game involves looking for people located in various areas of the Unified Force base, trying to figure out who the spy is. The simple turn-based combat is present in this installment as well. The player can choose to attack any person Blon-Win encounters; however, attacking an ally would result in a Game Over regardless of the battle's outcome.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The 4th Unit 2 is a direct sequel to The 4th Unit. The young and pretty bionic soldier Blon-Win has exposed the dark schemes of the trade organization WWWF. However, a new conspiracy is rising. WWWF has employed another bionic soldier, a young woman named Dalzy, who manages to seal Blon-Win's psychic powers. Blon-Win is arrested by WWWF and must find a way to contact her friends, escape, and defeat the treacherous organization.

The sequel follows the same gameplay format, being a predominantly puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure with an interface that combines menu-based verb selection and interaction with objects and characters highlighted on-screen. Compared to the previous games, the gameplay is more streamlined and the menu contains less commands. Rarely used options such as answering "Yes" or "No" during dialogues or the command "Rescue" have been eliminated.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Raymond Pardon was a gentle man. Maybe too gentle. Due to non-ability to defend himself against the accusation, he has spent last six years in a prison for a hold-up he did not commit. But the things were even worse: in addition to six years of imprisonment he lost his lovely wife, Mylène. 

Who was involved in this affair? To discover the truth, you as Raymond should perform your own investigation in seven European cities: Barcelona, Paris, Cannes, Rome, Amsterdam, Hamburg and London. In turns you'll behave as a gangster or as a journalist. It is up to you to perform the investigation in cold blood despite the lies and hired assassins. Someone must pay!

The gameplay flows as adventure in first-person view. You choose the place to visit and examine the objects there. Moving the cursor on the scene, you set its part in focus and may interact with it. Some of the objects may be added to your inventory and used later, some of the persons may share a valuable information with you, some of them may be hostile.

The game supports several languages: French, German, English, Italian, Dutch, and Spanish.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Akanbe Dragon can be seen as a forerunner to the company's long-running Super Robot Taisen franchise. On a one-screen playfield, you have a group of dinosaurs opposing a computer-controlled group of beasts. As in chess, you move your creatures around the board, each creature having different movement patterns and range; some move only diagonally, others move only short distances in the cardinal directions. When two creatures end up on the same square, a fight commences. Unlike the Super Robot games, these fights are totally interactive action sequences seen from a side view. You must move your dragon to evade enemy fire and try to shoot down the opposition. Each creature has different stats such as speed, jumping height, strength and shot. Depending on the square the fight takes place on, the milieu changes, which can be both a hindrance and a boon for different units.

Akanbe Dragon comes with a level editor for creating your own scenarios, and a continue option is also available if you lose the scenario.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The sequel to Aleste 2.It was released as a free game in Compile's now defunct WOOMB magazine. It is also known as Aleste Special, because it was released in the Disc Station 4 Aku Gau disc in Autumn.

Unlike Aleste 1, you are not controlling a spaceship, but instead you're controlling a robot. However, like Aleste, you can shoot enemies, enemies can shoot you, collect power ups, and defeat bosses at the end of a level. However, new to this game is the ability to jump over holes in the ground. This adds a new challenge to the game. In some levels, there are even obstacles like cars that you have to avoid. Power ups range from one that clones yourself and can fire lasers with you, one that replaces your default laser with shurikens. One replaces your default weapon and instead shoots red targets that go in a zig-zag. This laser has a possiblity of shooting enemies. The kinds of power-ups are marked by the color of their box-containers and the Japanese letter on them.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>20 years after the last fight with DIA51 an unidentified space fortress appeared and started an massive attack. Ray Waizen, the hero of the first Aleste game,  was a serving officer on board the first space ship that's been under attack and sadly got killed. His nineteen year old daughter, who is also a pilot, must save mankind and take revenge of her fathers dead...

This second installment of the Aleste series is as its predecessor: a very fast vertical shooter with a massive and extensive arsenal of weaponry. Many different types of enemy spaceships that are constantly attacking you and the area bosses are again huge screen filling bunkers.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The main difference of this vertical shoot 'em up with its predecessors Aleste and Aleste 2 is that in this installment of the series you're not flying a space craft, not even in a remote way. No, you are in control of a robot (maybe a humanoid). You are running around defending and attacking the enemy while avoiding obstacles and holes in the ground. For the rest it's pretty much all the same: it's fast, has many enemies, hard to beat level bosses and has lots of power-ups. If you destroy a space ship you will be rewarded with power-ups.</synopsis>

      <title>Ancient Ys Vanished - Omen</title>
      <synopsis>In this game, the player takes the role of Adol (Aron in the English-language Sega Master System version) Christin, a red-haired adventurer and expert swordsman. One day he encounter a fortune teller who sends him on a quest to find information about the six books of Ys. It appears that there was once an ancient land called Ys, whose secret was sealed in those six books. Before long Adol learns that the six books were all stolen by the evil wizard Dark Fact (Dulk Dekt in the Sega Master System version, Malificus in the English-language computer versions). It is Adol's task to defeat the villain and discover the secret of Ys!

Ys: The Vanished Omens is an action role-playing game with its own trademark combat system: instead of pressing the "attack" button, the protagonist simply runs into the enemies he encounters. More damage is inflicted upon the enemies if Adol charges at them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in the hero's death if the monster is stronger than him. The player gains gold and experience points for defeating foes; once enough experience has been accumulated, Adol levels up and becomes stronger. The hero can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.</synopsis>

      <title>Ancient Ys Vanished II - The Final Chapter</title>
      <synopsis>A bright light shot up from Darm Tower in the end of the first Ys, and Adol Christin is awakened by a young girl who finds him lying on the ground. She introduces herself as Lilia and tells Adol he is in the land of Ys. Finally he was able to establish a connection between his world and this mysterious land! But finding the gateway to Ys is not enough: Adol must stop an evil entity that his archenemy Dark Fact served. And his foes already know where he is.

Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished - The Final Chapter is a direct sequel to Ys: The Vanished Omens. The game continues to utilize the action role-playing combat style of the first installment, which requires the player to make the protagonist run into the enemy in order to cause damage, without the need to press an attack button. The player should choose the angles and the measure of contact with the enemy carefully, otherwise the hero will be killed. The player character can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade weapons and inventory, like in most other RPGs. 

The sequel offers a longer quest than the first installment, and adds a magic arsenal to Adol's abilities. Among the magic spells is a fire attack, a time-stopping spell, and a transformation ability that allows Adol to pass for a monster and converse with enemies. Magic spells deplete Adol's magic points bar.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Adol Christin's long-time friend, Dogi, wishes to return to his home town of Redmont after hearing about strange disturbances that are happening there.  Always looking for an adventure, Adol joins him and soon finds out the cause of this new evil.

Ys III: Wanderers from Ys breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games, allowing Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions. Beside changing the battle system, the game's perspective switches to a side-scrolling view, as opposed to the top-down one of the previous games. Adol also has the ability to jump now.  New to the series is the use of magical rings, which give Adol different powering-up abilities such as healing and shielding. The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.</synopsis>

      <title>Arctic - Active Rail Playing</title>
      <synopsis>Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as "active rail playing". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The people of the kingdom Arkases have mastered the ways of magic, thanks to their connection to the world of spirits. However, the humans used their magical powers to wage war on each other and to disrupt the harmony. Finally, the Golden Dragon told the king of Arkases that his country will be punished for the deeds of the humans. Enter Jedah Chaf, a young man who has left his home village to fulfill his dream of becoming a knight. Will Jedah be able to save his country and to restore peace in the world?

Arcus is a RPG that is played entirely from first-person perspective. You navigate your hero by choosing a location from a menu. Once in dungeons, you have a separate menu whenever you encounter enemies. You fight them in turn-based combat, attacking physically or casting magic. The game is more close to Western RPG style than to Japanese one, and utilizes AD&amp;D terminology for character stats.</synopsis>

      <title>Arcus II - Silent Symphony</title>
      <synopsis>Ten years have passed since the knight Jedah Chaf and his companions gained an audience with the Golden Dragon and made the choice that determined the destiny of the Arcusas land. The half-elf Picto was one of the five heroes who accompanied Jedah. A new adventure lies in front of him. Rumors of the legendary Rune Blade draw him out on a new quest, but his true mission will be to find his legendary companions and to rid Arcusas of a new terrible evil.

Visually, Arcus II is more similar to a traditional Japanese RPG than its predecessor. The navigation is done in top-down perspective in all the locations. The turn-based battles are still viewed from first person perspective. The enemies are visible on screen and the battle initiates once the player into contact with one of them. 

Despite its typical RPG structure and gameplay focus (party management, turn-based battles, large world to explore, etc.), Arcus II lacks several basic RPG features. The party receives only gold and no experience points from battles. There are no weapons and/or armor that the characters are able to equip; money can only be spent on healing items. Enemies can be therefore avoided altogether, and the game's challenge lies in the boss battles.</synopsis>

      <title>Balance of Power</title>
      <synopsis>The year is 1986. You take on the role of the US President or the Russian General Secretary. You have the full industrial capacity, covert forces, and military might of your country at your command. Your job? To make your country the world's most powerful and prestigious over the course of your eight years in office. Sounds easy, doesn't it? It would be if the other guy didn't have his finger poised over a red button that could wipe out the world! 

You must use diplomacy, make treaties, issue risky, covert CIA or KGB actions, or riskier, direct military intervention to prop up third world countries or help their insurgents and win them to your governmental philosophy: Capitalism or Communism. The world is a big place... and the other guy could start a nuclear war over a country as tiny as Tunisia. This game is the ultimate Cold War simulation. Every action requires careful analysis and the ability to judge your opponent (computer or human) and his reaction. The game features 62 countries, each carefully researched with up to date (as of 1985) information regarding their government, demographics, resources, etc.  </synopsis>

      <title>Bank Buster</title>
      <synopsis>The only way to break into a well-stocked bank is to head underground, and smash your way through layer after layer of earth. This makes for a game influenced by Breakout, but with many subtleties of its own.

You have full control over the bat, able to move up and down as well as left and right. The latter can be useful as only part of the bottom of the screen actually results in the ball going out of play - a wall protects much of the floor. There are inbuilt trees which can't be played through, and dynamite sticks which can clear large sections of earthing at a time.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Barunba is a shooter in comic style. 

You control a spacecraft that has a weapons ring around it and therefore can shoot in various directions. Weapons can be upgraded by shooting enemies and picking up the pods they might change in. The levels automatically scroll and move in all directions. Each level has its own theme and is quite long and has two bosses: a mid-level boss and an end boss. Both bosses have to be defeated before you can continue to finish the level or go to the next. A status bar at the bottom of the screen shows the energy bar of your ship and it's game over when that bar has depleted.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must collect all the bombs in order to complete the current round and go onto the next one. This sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs.

In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.

The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.</synopsis>

    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Breaker</title>
      <synopsis>Although it is a variant of the well-known Break-out, there are still some differences; One of them is that Breaker can be played with two bats. One bat is always at the bottom of the screen and can only move sideways. The other bat can move freely around the screen, but can not reach the bottom of the screen. The upper bat is the attacker sending the ball to the desired point, while the other one is the back up. If it is played by one player the second bat can be placed vertically; they always move sideways, only the upper one moves up and down. If it is played by two players each one gets one bat.

The other difference is the screen layout. Not only the screen is filled with special stones, but also with walls in different shapes that form a maze. Against these walls the ball just bounces, but if there is an opening at the top of the screen, allowing the ball to escape from the screen, the whole screen moves up a bit. While what is at the bottom of the image will disappear, a new piece appears at the top. At the bottom of the screen is the score, game level, the number of balls and the four bonus stones lights. 

There are five different stones; the first one is the familiar, colorful type; depending on the color, it is worth many points or just a few points. The second is the action stone, characterized by an arrow. This one acts like a flipper-bumper and gives the ball a push in the direction indicated to confuse the player. The last is the shrinkage/expansion stone; if hit, the bats become bigger or smaller. You also have the bonus stones in four colors. If you always touch one of the bonus stones of the same color, a light with that color will light up or go out at the bottom of the image. If all four of the same color lights are on, the player gets an extra ball. The special stones causes that the attack bat temporarily disappears. 

In the configuration screen the player(s) can set up the number of players and the controls; joystick, keyboard or mouse. The entire screen can also be moved with the controls.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>En el juego, cada jugador controla uno de los dos Bubble Dragons, Bub y Bob. El jugador puede moverse a lo largo de las plataformas, así como saltar a las de arriba y las del costado, de forma similar a la mayoría de los juegos de plataforma.

El jugador también puede hacer burbujas. Estas pueden atrapar enemigos, que son derrotados si la burbuja es reventada por la espalda espinosa del jugador. Las burbujas también flotan durante un tiempo antes de estallar, y pueden saltar sobre ellas, permitiendo el acceso a áreas que de otra manera serían inaccesibles. Los jugadores pasan al siguiente nivel una vez que todos los enemigos en el nivel actual son derrotados.</synopsis>

      <title>Can Can Bunny Superior</title>
      <synopsis>The second game in the  Can Can Bunny series follows the story of a young Japanese boy named Takeshi. One fine night he looks out of the window and notices a sexy girl undressing in the opposite building. "Oh, if only I could get her", sighs Takeshi. Immediately, the kind bunny-eared fairy Ariko from the Magic Land appears and... grants Takeshi's wish! He now possesses a Magic Book that will teach him ho to conquer the hearts of pretty girls... and not just the hearts!

Compared to the first game, Can Can Bunny Superior plays more like a stereotypical Japanese adventure, without the complications of buying items and alike, and with simpler menu commands like "Look", "Move", etc. In the beginning of the game, the player can choose between different initial statistics for Takeshi, which will influence the difficulty of conquering a particular girl. The game itself is divided into three separate scenarios, with up to four different girls in each (the scenarios begin in a shopping mall, aboard a plane, and in an amusement park), but the goal is always the same: talk to the girl in such a way that she will become yours.</synopsis>

      <title>Chaos Angels</title>
      <synopsis>One day, a lone traveler came from the desert to a small camp. There, he sat down, weary from his long travel, enjoying a short rest. "Have you heard of the Tower of Ouroboros"? - asked him a bearded old man who was sitting nearby. - "A legend says that if fulfills all your wishes. Many heroes tried their luck there. None has returned. Dangers lure at every corner in the tower, deadly enchantresses who will bring demise on anyone daring to set his foot there". Without answering, the young traveler left the camp, and soon he was standing at the tower gate...

Chaos Angels is a semi-erotic RPG similar to the first two Dragon Knight games. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. You gradually explore the huge 3D dungeon, the Tower of Ouroboros, fighting enemies and gaining experience points. The combat engine differs from most other Japanese-style RPGs: for attacking, instead of choosing an appropriate command from a menu, you hit the enemy by moving towards it. You can also sometimes see the enemies approaching and turn to different sides during battle. Like in Dragon Knight games, the enemies are mostly sexy girls wearing revealing clothes or simply naked.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In the year 2631, a small meteorite has fallen into the Galuga archipelago, located 20km northeast off the coast of New Zealand. Two years later, a terrorist group known as Red Falcon has seized the island in preparation for an alien invasion. The earth's marines sent two members of their elite Contra unit, Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, to neutralize the terrorists.

As either Bill (player 1) or Lance (player 2), the player must get to the end of each stage, shooting everything in sight, while avoiding enemy fire themselves. The player can upgrade their standard-issue rifle into one of four different weapons, including the powerful spread shot.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The Century Parody is a powerful battleship on its way to the trade station Samar. Shooting out of the KGD Star System in the year 3656 and into the Quila System you will land on to the mysterious trade station and along with your android companion Kayla uncover an ancient mystery.

Cosmic Soldier: Psychic War is the sequel to  Cosmic Soldier. Like the first game, it is a "dungeon-crawling" RPG where you control your character as he explores the many levels of Samar, encounters Psychic soldiers and fights in mental battles. Unlike the first game, the battles here are action-based, requiring quick reaction and timing. When encountering an enemy character you can shoot him or her with your mind beam and hopefully beat them. You will find clues and objects on your adventure which you can question Kayla with. You can use different psychic powers to fight, explore and defend yourself. Along the way you can also find allies that will want you join you on your quest and you will be able to use these characters as well in your battles. </synopsis>

      <title>Crimson</title>
      <synopsis>Crimson is a medieval-themed role-playing game similar to Dragon Quest. The player controls a lone character, a young man whose father sent him on a mission to defeat the evil monster Crimson before passing away. Exploration is done in an overhead fashion, and is divided into world map and hostile areas, which are usually maze-like and contain one or more dungeons each. In towns the hero can buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as rest in inns.

Enemies appear randomly, and the battles are turn-based. The player character can either attack, defend, or use an item. Combat is viewed from a first-person perspective. Unlike Dragon Quest, there are no random encounters on the world map. Exploration is non-linear, i.e. the player has access to many areas of the map from the beginning of the game.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Years have passed since the evil Crimson was defeated. Peace was restored, and humanity enjoyed an era of prosperity. But a new demonic being has arisen, ending the peace in the world. Five heroes must find each other and unite in order to vanquish him.

The sequel to Crimson retains the basic gameplay of its predecessor and is a medieval-themed role-playing game with overhead exploration and first-person turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies. The first part of the game is broken into chapters, each dedicated to one of the five heroes; afterwards, they are united as a party and continue the quest together, similarly to Dragon Quest IV.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The evil demon Crimson will not rest until humanity is destroyed. The powers of an ancient civilization made his resurrection more terrible than ever before: using robotic technology, he fused himself with a machine and became even stronger. Chosen heroes from different lands must meet each other and join forces to defeat Crimson once and for all.

Crimson III plays very similarly to its predecessor. It is a Japanese-style role-playing game with overhead navigation, first-person turn-based combat, randomly appearing enemies, and simple leveling up system. Like in the previous game, the player has to conclude initial chapters dedicated to each of the heroes before controlling them as a party on their main quest. Battles have an auto option, allowing the AI to take over the player-controlled party.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Viewed from above, Cytron is inspired by Paradroid and Alien Breed. The robot Cytron has been sent into a research facility in which robots have gone berserk, and it must safeguard the area and rescue the trapped scientists.

The character control is skittish, meaning that the droid is hard to stop instantly, which makes progression through the levels harder. One unusual feature is that the droid can be split into two components, Cyt and Ron, in a manner similar to Head Over Heels. This comes in useful when switches must be activated in a part of the level away from the force-field they unlock, as Cyt can be sent to flick the switch so that Ron can progress through the level as soon as it is flicked.</synopsis>

Shortly after their arrival at the camp dormitory, various girls become targeted by unknown assailants. In order to solve the mystery the two heroines must talk to their classmates, collect clues, and eventually find the culprits.

Abunai Tengu Densetsu is an adventure game with menu-based navigation and input. Most screens offer a fairly long list of verb commands, some of which must be combined with objects or persons selected from a sub-menu in order to interact with the environment. The game allows the player to visit many different rooms and other locations in any order; however, certain events must be triggered in order to advance, sometimes by repeatedly selecting commands. Certain situations require the player to find items and use them in a different location. The game contains scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.</synopsis>

Out of jealousy came doubt, then envy, anger, and finally hatred. Peace could no longer be maintained. Minions of darkness appeared among humans.

      <synopsis>The game takes place within a gigantic spaceship which has virtually infinite capacity because of its ability to manipulate time and space. The player must deal with enigmatic creatures called EVOL, which consist only of pure energy and need to keep themselves in capsules in order to maintain their existence in the world.
All of the characters in the game are designed to resemble microscopic organisms, both in their appearance and their quick, tricky movements. The player's ship undergoes over 10 types of transformations throughout the game, each with offensive and defensive maneuvers specific to their design. The sound effects used are minimal, but different types of sounds are used according to the type of shots or their speed. A sound resembling a long scream results when the player's ship is hit and returns to its weakest evolutionary state. The game's designer, graphic designer, and music composer, Tomo Furukawa, would go on to become the vocalist of the band Guniw Tools.The game controls like a regular shoot-'em-up: A and C shoot bullets, B drops bombs; there is rapidfire. However, unlike regular shoot-'em-ups where weapons are upgraded through powerups, your ship "evolves" to survive situations and get past obstacles. Evolution occurs with the Evol (small faces with an E on them) and B-Evol (darker Evols). Each pickup adds a new evolution state to the list. After a particular amount of time, one evolution wears off and the next evolution is chosen. The DNA powerup does provide a more permanent weapon upgrade, but will merely just make the existing weapons stronger. You can hold up to nine DNA powerups.</synopsis>

      <title>Diable de Laplace</title>
      <synopsis>The town Newcam, Massachusetts, 1924. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

Laplace no Ma (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to Sweet Home for NES. Unlike Sweet Home, this game is more oriented towards RPG gameplay. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</synopsis>

      <title>Digan no Maseki. Digan's Stone</title>
      <synopsis>A wedding ceremony is held in the village of Kartia, in the country of Oro. The warrior Dino is marrying the beautiful Abiria. After the wedding, the young couple heads to the sacred spring to inquire about their future. However, the goddess tells the newlyweds that pain and separation await them. Distressed, they return to the village, and shortly afterwards a terrible disease consumes Abiria. The local doctor explains that it might be a magical curse. In order to save his beloved one, Dino has to travel to faraway lands in search for a cure...

Digan no Maseki incorporates Western RPG elements into the Japanese template. Along with the menu-driven turn-based battles and simple character growth system, the game also features a day/night cycle; the heroes can get tired and hungry, so buying rations for longer trips is essential. It is also possible to purchase horses for faster travel. Another feature more typical for Western RPGs are conversation topics and freedom of action. Certain NPCs can be attacked at will, even if their disposition is friendly. Others will offer as vast choice of topics to discuss, ranging from general information about the game's lore and more mundane problems. A "show" commands even allows to hear NPCs' opinions about items in the party's inventory.

Visually, Digan no Maseki also resembles Western games, retaining little of the traditional anime/manga aesthetics.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Take control of a mechanical digging machine as you tunnel your way through the earth, searching for valuable gems and the even more valuable bags of gold!  But watch out for Nobbins and Hobbins, and don't be careless enough to let the bags of gold crush you!

Digger is an arcade game combining elements of the popular arcade games Dig Dug and Mr. Do!.  Players control the titular 'Digger' that can tunnel through dirt with ease.  The goal of each level is to gather up each of the gems, which allows you to progress to the next stage.  However, Nobbins and Hobbins are also lurking within the levels - Nobbins are fairly slow, but transform into Hobbins which are much quicker.  The enemies can only chase Digger through the tunnels he creates - they cannot dig through the dirt themselves.

Digger's defenses consist of being able to shoot a single, rechargeable shot in the direction he is facing with F1 (which recharges after about thirty seconds), crushing his foes by digging underneath a gold bag and letting it plummet down, crushing anything in its path, or by collecting the bonus cherry that sometimes appears, causing Digger to become temporarily invincible.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Originating in the arcades, Dragon Buster is an action platform game composed out of several large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. The player's goal in every level is to reach the final stage where the protagonist faces the level boss. There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, the player character moves through platform stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since it is impossible to heal between the stages. The hero's life meter (called "vitality" in the game) is the first introduction of such a feature to action games.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Dragon Eyes is a "space opera" kind of story, focusing on a young girl named Ines, who lives on the planet Miu of the Phi Sun. She grew up together with a space agent named Klind, to whom she refers as "brother". One day, her superior from the planet Garudoria informs her that Klind has disappeared during one of his missions and might be in danger. Ines travels to Garudoria to find additional information, and soon becomes involved in a vast space conflict...

Dragon Eyes plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, with commands such as Examine, Talk, Think, and Move appearing on every screen. Choosing one of those commands usually leads into a sub-menu of objects. There is also limited usage of items, which is sometimes required in order to advance in the game.

There are a few scenes with graphical nudity, but no explicit sex scenes.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Strawberry Fields was once a peaceful land. Ruled by the lovely queen Luna and populated only by women, the country knew no trouble. The Goddess Tower protected the inhabitants of Strawberry Fields. But recently, something happened in the tower. It is said that a dragon descended upon it, spawning an army of dragon knights who were threatening the peaceful land. The queen Luna summons you, a wandering adventurer, to descend into the depth of the Goddess Tower and to purge the evil from the land.

Dragon Knight marked the beginning of Elf's erotic RPG series. The game is played entirely from a first-person perspective. In the town, you move around by selecting destinations from a menu. Once you enter the tower, you navigate your character through 3D mazes, fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. Enemies in the game are scantily clad, attractive young women; there are also several scenes with explicit nudity.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Strawberry Fields - a magic country populated almost exclusively by beautiful young girls (that is, if we don't count the Wise Old Man and a couple of other male exceptions). All went well in this peaceful place, until the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country's lovely inhabitants and placed a curse upon them, turning them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might know as Desmond, the hero of Knights of Xentar), a young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the curse one has to find three sacred writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be very grateful!

Dragon Knight II is the predecessor to Knights of Xentar, the only Dragon Knight game that was ever translated into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. Takeru has to explore the three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various people.</synopsis>

      <title>Dragon Quiz</title>
      <synopsis>Taking its name as pun on the Dragon Quest series, Dragon Quiz is a hybrid of a role-playing and a quiz game.

Set in the very peaceful Quiz kingdom, the story revolves around a prince and his fair maid. One day, the Quiz king gives his son a pet dragon which the prince soon becomes very fond of. Unfortunately, his girlfriend is not equally fond of losing his attention, so she takes the dragon and leaves, intending to abandon it in a far-off place, so that it may never return and contend for her prince's love. Thus, the prince sets off to find his girlfriend and his pet dragon, somewhere in the Quiz kingdom. 

During his quest, the prince meets both friends and foes and lots of monsters. However, since this story is set in the Quiz kingdom, the battles are not fought using the usual RPG formula of weapons and magic spells. Instead, the monsters pose trivia questions which the player must answer. The prince loses hit points if a wrong answer is given. Getting the answer right awards the player with money, with which it is possible to buy equipment or lodge to regain health. Some adversaries won't let the prince pass unless he has made enough correct answers, which means that the player's quiz prowess is somewhat equivalent to experience points in normal RPGs.

The questions range from linguistic matters (usually questions about Hiroshima dialect) and game trivia to technical matters or the Thunderbirds.</synopsis>

      <title>Dragon Slayer 5 - Sorcerian</title>
      <synopsis>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between  Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.

The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.</synopsis>

      <title>Dragon Slayer II - Xanadu</title>
      <synopsis>Xanadu was the name of the summer capital of the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty in 13th century China. The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.

Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply "bumping" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.

Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.

Money can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a "karma" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many "good" enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.</synopsis>

      <title>Romancia - Dragon Slayer Jr.</title>
      <synopsis>This game exists in two editions, one for the MSX1 and one for the MSX2 with better graphics.

In Romancia: Dragon Slayer Jr., you are a young warrior whom the king sends on a mission to rescue a lost princess. You must leave the town and enter the dreadful monster-infested catacombs in order to complete your quest.

The game is a departure from Dragon Slayer RPG-oriented gameplay style. It tends more towards medieval-themed platformer action. The hero has hit points, can buy items and weapons, use magic, and stay in inns to recover health. However, instead of receiving experience points and becoming stronger, you simply must attack quicker (by bumping into your opponent on platform levels) and jump higher.</synopsis>

      <title>Dragon Slayer IV - Drasle Family</title>
      <synopsis>Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.
The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.

The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-restoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</synopsis>

      <title>Druid</title>
      <synopsis>Druid is an action game inspired by the arcade hit Gauntlet. As the eponymous hero, your job is to destroy four magic skulls hidden over eight levels. 

The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo. 

The druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. 

On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's spells, but the druid can only pick one item from each shop. 

The druid can also come across a pentagram on the ground which will restore his lost health. </synopsis>

      <title>Emerald Dragon</title>
      <synopsis>In Emerald Dragon the player takes control of Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...

The game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a "world map": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.

The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version of Emerald Dragon contains additional dialogue, scenes, and voice acting. </synopsis>

      <title>Exterlien</title>
      <synopsis>The plot of Exterlien is very simple: a beauty contest is held in an amusement park. Suddenly, monsters invade the park in an attempt to kidnap the girls. The protagonist, a young man named Masato, decides to venture into the dangerous zone and rescue the beauties.

Exterlien has turn-based battles against monsters, but it cannot be qualified as an RPG due to the extreme simplicity of the combat. The player should simply figure out which attack damages the monster most. There are no experience points, physical exploration, money, equipment, or any other essential RPG elements. The core gameplay is that of a Japanese menu-driven adventure: choose which location to go to, select the best attacks against a monster, be rewarded with erotic (very "softcore") images of the rescued girls.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Based on Ray Bradbury's classic science fiction novel Fahrenheit 451.

In a not so distant future, books have become illegal. As Fireman Guy Montag, the player's role is not to save houses, but to burn them for the books inside. However, Guy becomes passionate about books and becomes a rebel, pursued by the authorities. With the help of the Underground, he must survive and save books from complete extinction.

The game acts a sequel to Bradbury's novel.  Following the imposition of martial law Montag finds the young woman who inspired his resistance to the established order.  With her help he can now track down 34 microcassettes which hold the contents of the New York Public Library, then pass them on to underground members who will memorise the texts.

      <synopsis>Ring King is a boxing game in which the action in the ring is viewed in a 3D top-down view and a full range of moves is provided, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard.

Each punch weakens your opponent's strength which can slightly recover during a round break. A rain of well placed blows can produce a quick knockout, but normally you must hit your opponent many times before he goes down.

The game has three play modes. There is training mode to train your player before you enter a tournament. A ranking mode where you can select one of the three championships, Rookie, Japan and World. Each championship can be played at five difficulty levels. The third mode is the tournament mode. To reach the number one spot in the ranking or tournament mode you must train your boxer well.

Before you start you must create your character and set his initial abilities, strength, speed and stamina. Each won bout increases these abilities slightly. The abilities of your opponent and you are visible in the status bar at the top of the screen during the game. Strength is represented with a boxing glove, speed with a shoe and stamina with a dumb bell.

This game can be played by one player against the computer or by two players against each other. A password is given after each won bout and it enables you to continue with the next match in a tournament at a later time.</synopsis>

      <title>Fantasy Zone II - The Tears of Opa-Opa</title>
      <synopsis>In the past, the courageous hero Opa-Opa saved the Fantasy Zone from the invading Nenon forces, but his victory came at a price as he was forced to fight his own father who led the invasion. It is now Space Year 1432, 10 years after that battle, and the Nenon forces are once again spreading chaos through the Fantasy Zone. Opa-Opa must once again fly into the Fantasy Zone to rout the invasion. Similar to Defender, the player occupies a side-scrolling level that repeats indefinitely, and in which the player can freely travel left or right. Each zone contains several "bases" that serve as primary targets. New to the sequel are "warps" hidden behind certain bases that allow the player to travel between different zones. Each level has at least three zones, and when all of the bases have been cleared in all of the zones of a level, the player can travel through the warp to the boss. Boss fights do not allow for free travel as the main stages do, and force the player to face the boss or face a particular direction. Bosses are generally very large and change color to reflect damage taken. The final stage is a "boss rush" in which the player must fight a succession of previous bosses before fighting the final boss. There are two action buttons that correspond to two types of attacks, "fire" and "bomb". The fire attacks shoot horizontally, as in a typical shooter, and different variants can be purchased at shops. The bomb attacks are more powerful, and the basic bomb drops downward. Other variants have other behaviors and are limited in quantity. Shops, uncovered at key points, allow the player to purchase upgraded weapons, bombs, and speed, as well as extra lives.[8] Upgrades to Opa-Opa's speed (such as larger wings, or jet engines) are permanent as long as the player does not lose a life, but weapon upgrades are time-limited, and bombs limited in quantity. Items become increasingly expensive with subsequent purchases, encouraging the player to vary their purchases.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In year 691 of the celestial calendar, the dimensional control computer "Laxis" ran amok under the influence of an unknown interdimensional energy, striking out against mankind. Using its dimensional powers, Laxis escaped to another era. Using your dimensional controller-equipped power suit, the Arouza, you must hunt down and destroy Laxis.

Starting out in space, you control Arouza, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the metal knights in Herzog, as it flies towards the enemy. In the Space Harrier vein, you see your character from behind while enemies appear from the horizon. On later stages, set above the planet surface, the resemblance is stronger, especially since you can run on the ground. You have two weapon systems, consisting of a gun and target-seeking missiles, which have a limited supply. Arouza can be upgraded using powerups released when killing certain enemies. Upgrading is a good precaution before you encounter the end-of-level bosses, since you only have one life (with a power bar, mind you) to waste.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In Final Countdown the player takes the role of Laira Tyrik who is the commander of a space station. However, she is near an mysterious asteroid which threatens to destroy Earth. So she goes out to investigate and she finds an apparently deserted space station. She has to investigate all floors to be able to save Earth.

The main challenge of the game is to find a way through the maze-like corridors of each floor. Laira can either walk or use her jet pack for vertical movement which takes fuel. She also needs to watch our for obstacles like electrified bars which block certain passages and droids which are best avoided because of they see Laira, the time limit is shortened or they try to kill her. She has no weapons except for mines which have to be found on the station: laying the on the ground causes everyone to die who walks over them (including Laira). There are also other pieces of equipment to find, e.g. extra fuel.

Laira also often has to operate computer terminals to gain information and open closed passages, e.g. by opening doors, activating elevators or deactivating traps. While most of the game is shown from the side, the game switches to a first-person view and player has to type in commands to interact with the terminal; similar to using DOS. The terminal understands 13 commands which are explained in the manual. Mistakes in operating the system may result in an alarm and therefore a  time penalty.</synopsis>

      <title>Final Fantasy</title>
      <synopsis>The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil knight Garland, and then the real journey begins.

Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. He also gives the characters names. 

In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run). Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. 

Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style spell slots, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Retaining the same concept as the original Thexder but adding many improvements. The Fire Hawk robot had the same design as the Thexder: the main laser, shield, and ability to transform into a jet. It also had upgrades to allow it to launch guided missiles, and use special weapons found throughout the game. Obtaining special weapons caused a weapon carrier droid to be deployed, and if positioned correctly, would act as a shield against enemies. Graphics were improved from the original game, and game play was divided into sub-levels, with the fourth sub-level containing a "boss" enemy. It was also possible to restart later games at the beginning of a level previously visited.</synopsis>

You have an anti-grav pack that allows you to stop mid-air, move left or right but you are unable to move upwards. As you fall there are many aliens moving around the area and you must blast them with your laser while avoiding getting shot by them. On the left and bottom of the screen are two radars which show the position of the aliens either above or below, and left or right of your position. Using your anti-grav pack and laser uses fuel which is shown by a gauge which decreases and when you run out of fuel then it is game over.</synopsis>

      <title>Fray - In Magical Adventure</title>
      <synopsis>Fray in Magical Adventure, also known as just Fray and Fray-Xak Epilogue (Gai-den),is a 1990 spin-off "gaiden" (sidestory) game in a role-playing video game series Xak developed and published by the Japanese software developer MicroCabin. Even though it is directly connected to the more serious Xak storyline, Fray has a less serious tone and light-hearted comedic approach to telling the story. It was originally released for the MSX2 and was later ported to several different systems, among them MSX turbo R, PC-9801, PC Engine (as Fray CD), and Game Gear.
Fray is a simple action RPG. The game proceeds by the player's character Fray fighting through a preset overhead view map shooting opposing monsters, jumping over obstacles, and locating powerups and Gold, the game's currency, along the way. At the end of each stage the player will fight a boss and enter a town or safe haven where the player can purchase new equipment, hit points and the option to save their progress. Fray advances in power through the items that she can equip such as different rods and shields. Battles are in real-time as Fray walks around on automatic vertically scrolling game map as well as the monster characters. She has an attack and defense rating, and can switch between different projectile weapon styles as well as use special attacks and healing items</synopsis>

      <title>Ganbare Goemon! Karakuri Dochu</title>
      <synopsis>The second game in the Ganbare Goemon series (known in English as Mystical Ninja) and the first released on a video game console and home computer. It was initially released for the Family Computer July 30, 1986[1] and later released for the MSX one year later.
The game revolves around the main character, Goemon, and his exploits. As the name suggests, his character was based on Ishikawa Goemon, the noble thief of Japanese Folklore. Unlike its sequels, this game still doesn't feature the comic situation and strange characters that define the series, and Goemon is portrayed as a noble thief rather than a plain hero.[2]

The game plays a top view action/adventure game (similar to The Legend of Zelda) though it is separated by stages. In each level Goemon must find three passes in order to advance. Some of these passes are found in boxes, secret passages or can be bought. After finishing all the stages, the game will present you with a new Japanese province (eight total), but all the levels will remain the same. The ending, however, will be different.

Like the rest of the series, Goemon can be powered up if certain items are found and/or bought, which can be lost after a few hits.

The MSX version has the option to be played in turns by two players, with the second player playing as a ninja named Nezumi KozÅ, which is the basis of Goemon's sidekick Ebisumaru. In addition, unlike the Family Computer version, the game has six more provinces with completely new levels after finishing the game once.</synopsis>

      <title>Gandhara</title>
      <synopsis>Gandhara refers to the capital of the Kushan Empire, (today's Pakistan and Afghanistan), founded in 1st century BC, whose rulers were Buddhists; it was one of the most flourishing Buddhist states in history. The story of the game, however, is based on pure mythology, featuring Buddhist deities in their distinctly Japanese incarnations. The protagonist is contacted by the bodhisattva Akasagarbha (known as Kok?z? in Japan, from the Chinese Xukongzang), who tells him that the world is in danger: the king of demons is trying to locate and neutralize the holy Ashes of Buddha, whose power protects the eight worlds. The hero's task is to find the ashes and defeat whomever the king of demons might send to stop him.

One of  Enix's works that were unreleased outside of Japan, Gandhara is an action RPG with rather simple gameplay mechanics. The player navigates the hero through hostile top-down areas, fighting constantly respawning enemies with sword or magical spells. Rations must be bought in order to keep the hero alive. Defeated enemies grant the protagonist experience points; once a certain amount of those is accumulated, the hero levels up and grows stronger.</synopsis>

The player gets presented with a cube network and needs to find out the colours of the cube surfaces. After making a choice, the game says how well the attempt fared and the player needs to logically work the correct combination out by making more and more attempts. There are various options to set the game, e.g. the number of cubes, an optional time limit, the difficulty level or a limitation of attempts. An option for advanced players are cubes which change their positions between attempts.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Combining the gameplay of an arcade shoot'em'up with watching pretty girls, Girl's Control puts you in a spaceship, battling hordes of enemies flying downwards. All that flies is not an enemy, though; you can also shoot at blocks that, when shot, make up a picture of a pretty girl on the right of the screen. Picking up bonuses in the shape of the signs for "pretty girl" powers up your weapon. When all pieces of the picture are picked up, you are given a chance to enjoy the picture at your own pace before progressing to the next level (and the next girl). 

The gameplay can be spiced up by upgrading your spaceship into a much more "phallic" configuration, with bullets looking like big sperm, while the enemies come in the shape of scissors, mouths, pants and syringes. Your ship can also gain a condom shield. Whereas the MSX version starts off like a more normal shooter, progressively becoming more vulgar, this is the default mode in the Famicom version.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Goody es un videojuego de tipo videoaventura y plataformas desarrollado por la empresa española Opera Soft en 1988 para los ordenadores de la época Sinclair ZX Spectrum, MSX, MSX2, Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW y PC.

En el juego se encarna a John Nelson Brainner Stravinsky, alias Goody, continuamente perseguido por el oficial de policía Rodríguez, Charly el Bardeos, un navajero que trata de robarle y evitar con ello que Goody consiga dar su Gran Golpe, consistente en asaltar el Gran Banco, aparte de otros enemigos. Deberá recopilar los 13 cilindros que contienen los números de la combinación que servirá para abrir la caja fuerte del Gran Banco. Previamente deberá sustraer el mayor número posible de bolsas de dinero que le servirán para obtener las herramientas necesarias que puede comprar en la Ferretería. Estas deberán ser colocadas delante de las puertas estratégicas del banco; en caso de equivocarse de herramienta Goody será conducido a la cárcel.

Dispone de una escalera que puede utilizar en cualquier momento para alcanzar otras zonas inalcanzables, aparte de un potente salto que tiene en cuenta haber cogido carrerilla. Además, se puede ayudar lanzando ladrillos contra sus enemigos que según su fuerza de impulso podrán describir distintas trayectorias.

Los lugares por los que debe realizar su misión son las alcantarillas, varias estaciones de metro (Ópera, Gonzo, Retiro y Banco), la obra, el parque del Retiro, la mansión y el propio banco.

El juego tiene una elevada dificultad y unas características técnicas bastantes sobresalientes para su época. Dispone de música sólo en el menú inicial y efectos sonoros en el resto del juego.</synopsis>

The player controls an arsenal that includes laser-guided Hellfire missiles, a 30mm cannon controlled by helmet gunsights, clusters of bombardment rockets--even air-to-air missiles for duels with enemy helicopters.

The game starts with flight training at a base in the United States. Tutorials teach the player to handle the copter; once the controls and flying skills are mastered, there are escalating challenges and hundreds of missions in any one of four regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, Central America, the Middle East, and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies in Western Europe.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.

Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...</synopsis>

      <title>Andorogynus</title>
      <synopsis>In our universe matter and anti-matter co-exist with each other. However, prevalence of anti-matter may create chaos and eventually disrupt the normal flow of things. In a corner of a universe, a concentration of anti-matter led to the creation of an entire star, breeding forms of life threatening to destroy the world. Human beings, in an effort to save the universe, created the powerful Andorogynus - a life form capable of being male and female at once - and sent it on a mission to destroy the creation of anti-matter.

Andorogynus (sic) is a top-down shoot-em-up. The player controls the titular hero(ine), shooting at constantly attacking enemies. Unlike in most games of the type, the screen scrolls down rather than up. The protagonist is equipped with a default single shot and has protective orbs revolving around that damage nearby enemies. The weapon can be enhanced (rapid fire, three-way fire, etc.) by collecting randomly descending power-ups. The player controls the male incarnation of the protagonist initially, but later switches to the female one.</synopsis>

      <title>Herzog</title>
      <synopsis>The first, obscure instalment in the Herzog series is also one of the early precursors of the modern-day RTS (real-time strategy game) genre that was popularised by Dune 2. Unlike the common RTS game, the playfield is a long vertical stretch instead of the well-known map stretching in both X and Y axes. 

Another now unique trait is that there is little emphasis on building up a base to produce units which are then directly commanded into action. Instead, a base is already located at each end of the path, and the player is given control over a hovering battlemech. New units are bought using funds accumulated during play. These units, ranging from single foot soldiers to tanks and AA batteries, advance from the home base towards the enemy base. The player may pick up a single unit (or five soldiers) and move them closer to the enemy base in order to speed up the attack. A radar on the top of the screen gives an overlook of the battlefield.

The opposing faction has got the same resources, and the enemy battlemech will make raids towards your base, forcing you into mech-on-mech battle. This element turns Herzog into a rather unique blend of strategy and shoot'em up.

The game takes place in a balkanised region, where the last war has given birth to a new state, called Ruth. A military coup d'état in the now-independent state leads to a new war, which the peace-loving Mercies must win.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Based on the "Ho-o" (or "Karma" volume) of Osamu Tezuka's famous manga Hi no tori (or "Phoenix"), "Hi no tori Hououhen" is a vertically-scrolling shooting game where Gaou's goal is to locate the mystical phoenix across 6 stages of labyrinths, enemies and various other obstacles. As the game progresses, Gaou can power up by obtaining phoenix plumes to activate special weapons and other items to help him gain abilities such as invulnerability and special shots. In order to reach the final boss and pay a visit to the phoenix, Gaou must obtain a series of keys scattered across the stages - and must even backtrack to find others. The game is over when all three lives are gone - or when Gaou has reached the phoenix's lair.</synopsis>

The goal is to sail around until the player finds a pirate ship (the friendly green merchant ships will simply provide hints) and clear the boss. Doing so will allow the player to collect a port key which allows them to set anchor on one of the titular seven islands. The player must then remove the boss of that island and recover the treasure. At which point, the process must be repeated.</synopsis>

Only by vanquishing Varalys can the curse be lifted. Once the princess is restored the kingdom will be saved.

Hydlide is an action game with strong role-playing elements. The player has to explore vast wilderness areas, descending into dungeons and eliminating enemies on the way. Combat system is similar to the one implemented in Ys series: attacking enemies requires the player to "bump" into them, at the same time preventing them from attacking the playable character from the sides and the back. The player can change between defensive and offensive stances by pressing a single button. Magic spells can also be used to dispose of the enemies. The player character grows stronger and gains better parameters as he advances in the game.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy. Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply "bumping" into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player's morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game's most decisive battles.</synopsis>

The ninjas bravely defend their village, but, being vastly outnumbered, are mercilessly slain by Nobunaga's men. Only one survived: you, the hero of the game. Shortly before the assault you were sent to a nearby village to warn the elder of Nobunaga's attack. However, the other village is also destroyed by Nobunaga's army. You swear to avenge his crime.

      <synopsis>Intruder is a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a space ship, flies from left to right and shoots everything on the way; preferably without dying from collisions or enemy bullets. The standard gun shoots both forward and backwards and can be upgraded by collecting power ups on the way. The game uses a gravity system: the player always needs to counter steer st avoid crashing to the ground.

Regarding power ups, the player needs to look out for symbols which have negative effects and should be avoided. Points for the high score list are also handled through power ups and shooting enemies rewards no points. Collecting an extra gives an automatic boost in one direction. </synopsis>

      <title>Storm of the Meiji Restoration</title>
      <synopsis>Ishin no Arashi is set during Bakumatsu period (around 1850 until the Meiji Restoration of 1867), the final stretch of the Japanese Edo period, which was a turbulent time, a time of great struggle between the supporters of the feudal shoguns, the rulers of the country, and the adherents of the Emperor, which eventually won and carried through the Meiji Restoration, turning Japan into a modern, powerful state. In Ishin no Arashi the player can choose one of the three major battles of Bakumastu period, and decide which leader will eventually propel Japan towards the Meiji era.

This strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known  Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other  historical simulation games by  the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.</synopsis>

      <title>Isla del Tesoro, La</title>
      <synopsis>Jim Hawkins is a young boy working on "Admiral Benbow", his parent's inn. One day a sea captain named Billy Bones takes a room at the inn and stays for several months. A blind man called Pew arrives and shows something to Billy that gives him a heart attack. Jim witnesses everything and runs to aid the captain, who tells him about his sea chest and his relationship with Captain Flint, a famous pirate. After he dies Jim grabs the key dangling from the corpse and opens the dead captain's chest to collect the last payment. He finds a packet inside, and decides to take it to two aristocratic acquaintances of his, Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney. They discover a diary and a treasure map, and decide to travel to the island in search of the booty.

Treasure Island is a text adventure, an adaptation of the classic 1883 novel of the same name by Robert Louis Stevenson. Unlike the book, the game is written in a second-person perspective. Otherwise, it follows the original plot closely: the player assumes the role of Jim Hawkins, and has to perform the same actions as the character in the novel. This leads to a more claustrophobic design, as players without knowledge of the book have to guess what to do next. To help alleviate that problem, other characters act as some sort of built-in hint system. The player can ask them about anything and they will provide clues when these are available. The parser accepts most of Infocom's standard features like pronouns and chain commands.(Moby Games)

Jim Hawkins es un chico joven que trabaja en el Almirante Benbow, posada de sus padres. Un dÃ­a, el capitÃ¡n de un barco llamado Billy Bones toma un lugar en la posada y se queda ahi durante varios meses. Un hombre ciego llamado Pew llega y muestra algo a Billy que le da un ataque al corazÃ³n. Jim, que es testigo de esto, corre a la ayuda del capitÃ¡n, que le habla sobre un cofre del tesoro y su relaciÃ³n con el CapitÃ¡n Flint, un famoso pirata. DespuÃ©s de que muera Jim recoge la llave colgada del cadÃ¡ver y se abre camino al cofre del capitÃ¡n muerto para cobrar el Ãºltimo pago. Ãl encuentra un paquete en el interior, y decide llevarlo a dos conocidos aristÃ³cratas, el doctor Livesey y Squire Trelawney John. Descubren un diario y un mapa del tesoro y deciden viajar a la isla en busca del botÃ­n.

La Isla del Tesoro es una aventura de texto, una adaptaciÃ³n de la clÃ¡sica novela de 1883 del mismo nombre de Robert Louis Stevenson. A diferencia del libro, el juego estÃ¡ escrito en una perspectiva en segunda persona. De lo contrario, se sigue la trama original de cerca: el jugador asume el papel de Jim Hawkins, y tiene que realizar las mismas acciones que el personaje de la novela. Esto conduce a un diseÃ±o mÃ¡s claustrofÃ³bico, a medida que los jugadores, sin el conocimiento del libro, tienen que adivinar quÃ© hacer a continuaciÃ³n. Para ayudar a aliviar este problema, otros personajes actÃºan como una especie de sistema integrado de pistas. El jugador puede preguntar acerca de cualquier cosa y se le proporcionarÃ¡ pistas cuando Ã©stas estÃ¡n disponibles. El analizador acepta la mayorÃ­a de las caracterÃ­sticas estÃ¡ndar de Infocom como pronombres y los comandos de cadena.</synopsis>

      <title>Jack Nicklaus Golf</title>
      <synopsis>Jack Nicklaus Golf brings Accolade's golf series to the Game Boy with a selection of courses from the computer versions and most features and options also present.

Four courses are available: Jack's Greatest, Castle Pines and Desert Mountain as previously seen in Greatest 18 Holes and Muirfield Village from Unlimited. Gameplay modes are skins (for two to four players) and stroke play (for one to four players). Players can choose their golfer's gender and select from beginner and expert skill levels and different tee modes (professional, men's and women's). Besides playing the complete course, there are also practice options for a single hole, the green, and a driving range.

Playing a hole begins with a top-down overview of the hole, followed by the standard view from behind the golfer. Strokes are done with the standard three-click method: start, power, and accuracy. During play, it is possible to pull up the hole overview, look at the score card and statistics and change the weather conditions. The game also offers replays and mulligans.</synopsis>

      <title>Joker</title>
      <synopsis>Joker is set in the time period commonly known as the "Old West" or "Wild West" in the United States of America. The protagonist of the game is a young man nicknamed Wild, who lives in a quiet Native American village. Years ago, the village was hit by something its inhabitants have since called "The Great Disaster". In order to seal the forces that caused the catastrophe, Wild's father sacrificed his own life. Now, the ceremonial day of the White Magic approaches. The youngest in the line of witches, a girl named Laura, must predict the future for the village and the world. For an unknown reason, Laura is unable to see into the future. Concerned, the village elder sends Wild on a mission to the nearby town, to find out what could cause this and if there is a way to prevent the Great Disaster from returning...

Joker is essentially a Japanese-style adventure, with strictly menu-based interface, still screens viewed from first-person perspective, and no real puzzles. However, the game offers more interaction possibilities and less linear progression than it is usually the case in comparable games. The player must explore the town and talk to its inhabitants in order to advance the story and get to the bottom of the mystery.

The game has scenes with nudity and rather mild depictions of sexual situations.</synopsis>

      <title>Joker II</title>
      <synopsis>Joker II continues the story that started in  Joker. In the end of the first game, the young hero Wild had to confront the sorceress Claudia, who intended to resurrect the evil Joker, which caused what the Native Americans of the region called "The Great Disaster". Six months have passed since the tragic outcome of those events. Wild is taken care by his friends and companions. The same nightmare pursues him: he sees his sweetheart Laura calling for him, begging him to save her... Wild has to rebuild his life from scratch, but this nightmare ties him to his past... so he ventures out to look for answers once again.

Gameplay-wise, Joker II is pretty much identical to its predecessor. It is a Japanese-style adventure without puzzles, but with more interaction and exploration possibilities than it is usually the case with games of its genre. Graphically the game also looks very similarly; since most of it takes place in the same locations, many images were simply transferred from the first game.

Like its predecessor, Joker II has several scenes with nudity and mild sexual situations.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Jumper! is a freeware platform game starring Ogmo, a creature created in a lab by the army as a weapon of mass destruction. After all attempts to contain it fail, Ogmo escapes from the cell and starts to negotiate the many traps left on every room of the abandoned research base to finally break free. The main character is controlled with the arrow buttons: left and right for movement, up for jumps. Ogmo is able to do a double jump in mid-air, somersaulting to land on high places.

Each screen is configured as a self-contained puzzle with many devices and platforms. Progress is automatically saved at the start of each room. Ogmo has to be guided to the exit, carefully avoiding contact with hazardous features like spikes, lightning arcs and bottomless pits. Helpful items like golden arrows and super pads have to be touched to give extra jumps, allowing Ogmo to deftly reach a top platform. There's a level editor included to create custom puzzles.</synopsis>

Pick up, rotate and place the objects to form a mystery image in the grid. You can display the actual image you are attempting to mirror, but your limited fund of time depletes more quickly while this is visible. 

Puzzles can be broken down into between 4 and 96 pieces. Many of the MicroKinema are animated, which gives you clues as to what should be placed where, and which way up.

Quick thinking and creativity are the keys. The puzzles can be saved, and played alone or with a friend.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Far, far into the future, inter-planetary archaeologist Vick XIII, makes a choking discovery. The pyramids on earth are malfunctioning devices of alien origin with enough energy to destroy earth. And it's up to Vick to switch off the core functions of El Giza.

The game consists of six pyramids each with its own wall engravings and color pattern; every pyramid contains 10 levels. The idea of the game is to collect crystals called soul stones in each level by solving the different puzzles and evading or killing the enemies using the many tools and weapons available to unlock the exit door that will take you to the next level.

The game was released both for the MSX1 and MSX2 systems. The MSX2 version only saw a release in Japan. The MSX 2 version was the same game except minor changes like the music was remixed and some of the items and backgrounds recolored.</synopsis>

The Ancients abandoned the planet, leaving behind many different artifacts and ships, which you can loot. Send your droid to retrieve modules and try to figure out what the ancient technology is for. It could be batteries, shields or even weapons, to help you fight the trigger-happy saucers that want you dead.

The game uses fractal graphics, the terrain is vast and detailed, and the story behind it is quite complex, considering the type of game.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>"Eindeloos" once was a popular tourist attraction. People from all over the world came to see the subterranean wonders of the huge cave system. But this came to an end when an alien super-being was awakened by an exploration on one of Neptune's moons. Angrily, the super-being directed his eyes to Earth and took up residence in "Eindeloos" and turned it into a fortress. The super-being then took a form of a mystic heart and went back to slumber. The player now has to descend with a helicopter in "Eindeloos" to defeat the super-being and its hordes. 

The player has control over a helicopter in a multidirectional perspective. While the player is exploring the immense caves, it is very important not to be hit by the many moving obstacles such as mines, scroll tracks and energy wires. Also the enemies, who resemble winking skulls (and can take different forms) will attack the player. Fortunately, they can be destroyed with the fire button of your joystick or you can lure them so that they fly up against the obstacles. To continue, the player can change the direction of the funnels and doors by pressing on levers and arrows with the space bar. If you use the spacebar on an exclamation mark, you can continue from the exclamation mark after a crash. The player starts the game with 14 helicopters. </synopsis>

      <synopsis>Christmas 1999: an atomic war has begun. Most of the Earth's population was wiped out. Only a few millions remained. Three years have passed, and the leading scientists of the world started working on a project to re-build the planet. But not everyone agreed with them; some people were profiting from the chaos and devastation. Those people founded a terrorist organization called "Black Widow", with the goal to impede the project. To counter that, project leaders hired a group of five trained agents known as "Snipers". The protagonist of the game is a Class-A sniper named Joe, who is about to be trained by his colleagues...

L Elle is a point-and-click adventure in Japanese style (no puzzles). The interaction with the environment is performed by moving the mouse cursor around; when it is possible to interact with an object, the cursor turns into a command icon (look, talk, push, take, etc., depending on the situation). The navigation is performed by selecting locations from a menu. The player advances by examining objects, talking to people, and unlocking new locations.</synopsis>

      <title>Last Armageddon</title>
      <synopsis>The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.

Last Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic  Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.

Dungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.</synopsis>

These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</synopsis>

      <title>Let's Take The A Train</title>
      <synopsis>A Ressha de Ikou is the first in the long-running transport network simulation series mostly known as A-Train.

The player controls a railroad company CEO in the end of the nineteenth century, who was entrusted by the president of an unnamed country to build a railroad that reaches its Western coast. The game is played in real time, with a day/night cycle and a game world that changes regardless of the player's actions. Compared to its more widely known sequels, A Ressha de Ikou has a rather simple gameplay that is confined to building tracks for just one train line, the titular A-train. A report is generated that shows how well the player is doing in his/her competition against other networks.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Lingo is a digital version of the TV game show of the same name. Like in the game show it is the objective to guess five letter words. You are only given the first letter. You get several tries and with each try the letters are marked which are correctly placed and those who appear in the word but at a different location. Within words you get to blindly draw a ball from a pool. There are 17 numbered balls that correspond with a numbers on a bingo card. There's a ball with a question mark that let the players pick a number at will. When the players complete a row or column they receive bonus points. There's also three red balls that passes the turn to the other player and three green balls. A green ball allows you to pick another ball and also when you get three green balls before the game is over you win a jackpot. The game starts with two players, but after some rounds the player with most points goes to the finale. The game is in Dutch so only features Dutch words. It contains a library of 15,000 words. There's also options for six and seven letter games. It is officially licensed by the Dutch iteration of the game show and thus includes the Dutch TV presenter François Boulangé.</synopsis>

      <title>Lipstick Adventure</title>
      <synopsis>In Lipstick Adventure, the player takes the role of Gorou, a young Japanese private detective. One day, a wealthy and powerful old man contacts him and asks him to find a box which - according to him - contained a family treasure. The young detective thinks that fortune has finally smiled to him, but when his pretty girlfriend Otomi disappears, he realizes that the mystery is bigger than he thought...

The game is a traditional Japanese adventure, with the usual first-person view and "Look - Talk - Think - Move" interface. There are no puzzles, and the game usually advances the plot when all the commands at a given screen are depleted, sometimes requiring to visit different locations several times.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>This is the second entry in  Lipstick Adventure series. Once again, the protagonist is the young private detective Gorou. One day his girlfriend Otomi introduces to him a customer, a man who calls himself Sakamoto. When Gorou meets him at the train station, Sakamoto hands him a suitcase, saying he should deliver it to his company in Osaka.

    <id>186144</id>
    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>M.U.L.E.</title>
      <synopsis>M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.

You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.

Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.

After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.

After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.

Third phase is the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for various tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. 

There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are: 

- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it. 

- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.

- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).

- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.

- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.

- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.

- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.

- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.

The game always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer. </synopsis>

      <title>Maison Ikkoku Final</title>
      <synopsis>The game is based on the manga Maison Ikkoku by Rumiko Takahashi.

Set in Tokyo of the 80's, the story can be described as a romantic tale with a touch of comedy. It centers on a boarding house which is managed by the young and lovely widow Kyoko Otonashi. The protagonist is a college student named Yusaki Godai, and his relationship with Kyoko is the main plot line. The game's story approximately corresponds to the middle volumes of the manga until the conclusion.

The game is a "puzzle-less" adventure, the gameplay mostly focusing on simply depleting all the verb commands at every given screen and moving between locations. The commands include the usual "Look", "Talk", and Move" typical for Japanese adventures (no "Think" command), but also context-sensitive commands "Eat", "Drink", etc., as well as the possibility to use certain inventory items.</synopsis>

One happy ending and four unhappy endings were used in the game; becoming one of the first video games to have multiple endings. The game was not very successful, but it started appearing frequently and getting high prices on online auction sites like Yahoo! after 2000, when Masashi Tashiro was arrested and convicted several times in connection with voyeurism and drug abuse.</synopsis>

      <title>Mash? Denki La Valeur</title>
      <synopsis>In this game, the player controls a swordsman named Alan. One day he arrives at the village of Flodi, and finds out that his help is needed: the daughter of the village elder, Sophia, has been kidnapped by monsters and taken into the nearby cave. Naturally, rescuing Sophia is just the first quest among the many perils that await the hero on his journey...

La Valeur is a RPG that mostly follows the Japanese format: the hero wanders through the top-down locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, gaining money and experience, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion. 

However, there are also some less traditional features in the game. There are three classes of weapons, distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies are strong/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them, and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.

The entire quest is played solo, without party members. There is no "world map", which is characteristic for other games of this kind. The gameplay is heavy on "level-grinding"; typically, a certain level must be reach in a given area before the hero is able to defeat the boss enemy. After having reached this level, regular enemies of that area stop giving experience points.</synopsis>

      <title>Master of Monsters</title>
      <synopsis>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler  after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. 

Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.</synopsis>

It just had to be Arkanoid; an arcade game first developed by Taito in 1986, expanded from Atari's breakout that has now been cloned for the MSX.
Two decades later from the original release, Javier Lavandeira coded a great Arkanoid clone for the MSX with fine Moonblaster music, however it was only for friends. Yet this week all of you can now play Matrix: Quest for Deliverance a brilliant Arkanoid clone that's regarded as one of the best homebrew releases for the MSX

   " Hereâs a game for MSX2 computers that I released on October 1994. It was never released commercially, but I gave copies to friends. Iâm now releasing it to the public domain.The game is just another Breakout / Arkanoid clone. It has great FM-PAC / Music Module music composed by Carlos GarcÃ­a. Iâm guilty of all the coding and graphics." (MSX.org)</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Near the end of the 20th century, a small fortified nation named Outer Heaven (founded by a mysterious war hero whose name and identity are shrouded in secrecy) is threatening the nations of the "West" with the development of a new prototype weapon named Metal Gear, a walking tank which is capable of launching nuclear warheads from anywhere on the globe. As FOX-HOUND's (an elite black ops unit) newest recruit, going by the codename of Solid Snake, your mission is to infiltrate Outer Heaven and rescue your missing comrade, Grey Fox (who was captured after a failed infiltration), while gathering intelligence on Metal Gear. 

In order to fulfill this objective, the player must collect various weapons and equipments (including keycards for further access into the fortress), while avoiding visual contact with the enemy. The player must also confront bosses in the form of Outer Heaven's elite mercenary force and rescue hostages hidden within the fortress in order to increase player rank, which gives Snake an extended life bar and increased storage capacity for replenishable items and ammo. The player can use a wireless transceiver to come in touch with their commanding officer, Big Boss, to learn more about their current mission objectives or contact one of the local resistance members operating covertly within the fortress to gain useful tips and insights.</synopsis>

      <title>Metal Gear 2 - Solid Snake</title>
      <synopsis>In 1999, a great scientist named Kio Marv invented "oilix", a special petroleum-purifying substance that was supposed to help in the upcoming oil crisis. Shortly after the invention became known in the world, Dr. Marv was abducted. An investigation showed that he was held captive in Zanzibar Land, an isolated state in Central Asia which was ruled by a group of mercenaries from all around the world. Having oilix in addition to nuclear weapons are bound to Zanzibar an invincible state that would sooner or later attempt to conquer the entire world. Roy Campbell, ex-commander of special unit FOXHOUND, sends Solid Snake, the man who has single-handedly brought down the military nation of Outer Heaven four years ago, on a mission to infiltrate Zanzibar and to bring back the scientist and his invention.

Like its predecessor, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake is a stealth game. The driving element of the gameplay is to stay unnoticed. If guards spot you, you don't have much chance in combat, unless you are armed with appropriate weapons, which aren't easily acquired. Snake can use a variety of weapons and gadgets to help him survive during his mission. He can also hide behind objects, punch guards, and crawl. From time to time he'll have to participate in boss battles, where stealth won't help any more.</synopsis>

Snake puede usar una variedad de armas y artilugios para ayudarlo a sobrevivir durante su misión. También se puede esconder detrás de objetos, golpear guardias y gatear. De vez en cuando tendrá que participar en batallas contra jefes, donde el sigilo no ayudará más.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>When the epic, thousand-year-old battle between different dragon clans was finally over, and the benevolent White Dragons started ruling the country of Akranis, it looked like the age of peace has finally arrived. But all changes when the dragon rider Kain finds an ancient weapon known as the Rune Blade. He brings it to the old white dragon Yoshua, who tells him that a powerful protective artifact has been stolen, and the fateful hour has come to Akranis... with the help of his dragon Sarken, Kain has to restore peace and save Akranis and the dragon race.

The game is a rather unusual example of a side-scrolling action game, in which the player controls a dragon. Sarken is able to fly in any direction, but so are the enemies in the game, most of which are other dragons. The dragon has a HP bar which is depleted when he is damaged by enemy attacks or traps. Beside physically attacking, the dragon can also learn and cast offensive and protective magical spells.</synopsis>

      <title>Might and Magic Book Two - Gates To Another World!</title>
      <synopsis>The space traveler and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world VARN, where he was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a party of local adventurers helping him. The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun. 

Gates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.

Like in the previous game, character classes rely each on a particular attribute to be effective. Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return, with the addition of two new classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection features humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A new feature is the possibility to hire two non-player characters to travel with the party and participate in battles. A new skill system is introduced as well, allowing characters to learn such abilities as mountaineering (necessary to traverse mountains), linguist (for reading certain messages), cartographer (for creating an auto-map), and others.

Compared to the first game, the sequel is more quest-oriented, with various characters in towns giving quests to the party, as opposed to purely exploration-based traveling in the predecessor. Time also plays a large role in this game, with some instances requiring the party to travel to different time periods. Characters also age as the game goes on; If the player waits too long, the characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging, and they will eventually die. </synopsis>

      <synopsis>In Miracle Warriors: Seal of the Dark Lord, you have been asked to recover the Golden Seal which is being guarded by the Dark Lord Terarin.  You start your quest by yourself, but you must find three other companions who will join you to defeat Terarin. You also must venture through five lands. You will find villages, towns and castles in your travels in these lands. In each, you will find or be able to buy weapons and armor (both for you and your companions), medicine and clues. You will also find caves, dungeons, and monuments that are scattered. Some you may enter unhindered. Others will be locked until you find the right person or learn the right spell. 

Also within each land, you will encounter monsters such as evil merchants, Weasly wimps, Unmutaks, Great Lions, Gelfises, Zirods, and many more. Some of these monsters do less damage than others, and  take more damage themselves. You can either attack them yourself using your weapons or spells, or make your companions attack the monsters themselves. When defeated, most monsters will either leave behind some coins, which you can spend to buy stuff at the towns, or some items, which you can also use to defeat monsters.

However, not all inhabitants are monsters. You will also meet merchants and travelers who might tell you where to go and what to do.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The year is 720 of the Galactic Era. Humans have ventured into deep space and found they were not alone in the universe. Alien life forms populated the galaxy, both friendly and hostile. The Rainbow Nebula is home to that last kind, and the protagonist of the game is the only one who can fight them.

Mirai is a sci-fi shooter with strong role-playing elements. The player controls the protagonist who uses a jetpack to fly through scrolling maze-like environments. Experience points and money are gained from defeating the numerous respawning enemies. Money can be used in the few friendly areas to purchase weapons and items. The player also has to keep an eye on the fuel gauge for the protagonist's jetpack.</synopsis>

      <title>The Mon Mon Monster</title>
      <synopsis>In most games you have to attack monsters as a hero. In this case you are the reincarnation of the creature of Dr. Frankenstein. The opponents, however, remain monstrous. Mon Mon Monster is an arcade platform game with some touches of adventure. With your monster, you have to make your way through a maze of screens. Your path is blocked at all times by boulders and annoying creatures. The action takes place over the entire screen with the exception of some information at the bottom. In the fields you can find lots of useful objects such as "rocks", the normal method of defeating an opponent is simply done with the fire button. With this you reach the effect of a punch stroke or when you are standing at a distance, you shoot a projectile. You throw the boulders using a combination of the stick and 2nd fire button. Not really easy but practice makes perfect. You can also find extra life or supplement the remaining energy. Even secret passages are not lacking in this game nor are difficult passages such as water fountains. With a press of the STOP key you pause the game and a card is also placed on the screen. On that card you can read your current posfty as well as the screens you have already viewed and also the position of the Boss is indicated. However, this card does not help you much, since you still have to reach your goal through secret passages. I have not yet finished the first internship. Have you lost all your lives you can continue to play through a continuous option. However, you will still start at the beginning of the internship, but items that have been retained will be retained. Mon Mon Monster looks graphically well-cared for The music is welcome, thanks to the fact that the musical possibilities of the FM-Pac are used. The movements are smooth and "Frankie1" lets you steer well The idea is not very interesting, but still fascinating.</synopsis>

      <title>Murder on the Mississippi</title>
      <synopsis>The famous detective Sir Charles Foxworth is taking a holiday on the Mississippi with his servant Regis on the Delta Princess. He's just taking a stroll around the upper deck of the ship when he discovers an open cabin door. Behind it: a dead man. As it turns out, the body of Raleigh Cartwright III. Sir Charles has three days to find the murderer, because then, the ship will reach New Orleans, giving the culprit a safe chance to escape. The joystick controls the player's sprite to move into the respective direction, and pressing the button opens a menu with appropriate commands for the current situation. Walk around, Inspect an item, or examine evidence. You will meet some characters who also happen to be suspects. Use these encounters as a fact-finding session. Take notes on what he or she has said. Share these notes with other passengers and crew members. But your first job is to find the body. Until you do, any information you gather will be of little value. Once you find the body, the other passengers will prove to be much more talkative. Collect as many notes and evidence as you can to solve the mystery. Once you think that you have it solved, make an accusation by going to the character that you want to accuse and by using the joystick, point to Talk to [character's name], and press the joystick button. Then point to Accuse [character's name] and press the joystick button. Depending on the amount of evidence collected, you will know if your hunch was right or wrong. Murder on the Mississippi has four possible endings with many variations on each one. Don't let the Delta Princess arrive to New Orleans before you solve the mystery, or the murderer will get away.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Early in Japan's edo era, circa 1630, peace had continued in the western province of Ohkami until the feudal lord passed away. Gyokuro, an evil emperor, gained power and his oppressive rule caused great hardship to the people, and the princess who opposed him was confined to a dungeon somewhere in the Ohkami castle. Gyokuro has the Ohkami ninja under control at his command. Utilizing various ninjitsu techniques, in addition to the one that transforms them into a wolf, they protect him from the people who are his enemies.

You play Kazamuru, a great warrior who challenges the clan to a fight in order to rescue the princess. However, he can't rescue the princess unless he finds the five scrolls in the thirteen areas of Ohkami. On his quest, he must defeat various ninjas such as Kuno-ichi and Ninniku, as well as fire-blowing ninjas, slashing ninjas, and footloose ninjas. You'll explore grassy fields, shrines, river banks,  towns, and the castle itself. Some of the steps have varied gameplay. For example, you must avoid boulders in Step 2, must use logs in order to cross a river in Step 5, avoid being trampled on by horses in Step 7, and scale a cliff in Step 9.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The game tells another story in Ninja-kun series. This time itâs a platform game with some twists. There are two tasks alternating through levels: you are required either to kill every enemy in the level (as in the previous games) or simply to reach the exit. Running into enemies usually wonât kill you, however if you are hit by a single projectile, youâll have to start from a checkpoint. Enemies vary from plain ninjas to giant skeletons or killer fish. Each level has a time limit, and when this limit is close to an end a fire wheel of death will appear on the screen, chasing Ninja-kun.

Ninja-kun has some techniques for successful progression though the levels: many enemies can be temporarily stunned by jumping on them or hitting them from below; and ninja can obtain some power-ups including boomerang, bombs, a devastating fire attack or invincibility. Ninja-kun is capable of wall climbing and wall jumping, the latter requiring some practice from the player.

The levels (called âscenesâ in-game) are scattered through mountains, caves, beaches and underwater locations. You can choose which set of levels youâll start in by playing a mini-game at the beginning.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Nobunaga no Yabou: Sengoku Gunyuuden is the third game in the Nobunaga series. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.

The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Nobunaga no Yabou: Zenkokuban is the second game in the Nobunaga series. In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</synopsis>

      <title>Nyancle Racing</title>
      <synopsis>Nyancle Racing is a top-down racing game from Japan. The gameplay is reminiscent of the 1983 classic Bump 'N' Jump. The player controls a vehicle shaped like a mechanic animal on a track filled with obstacles, collectable rolling pieces of candy (the game currency) and other enemy racers. The main objective is to arrive at the end before the timer runs out. The competition tries to delay progress by bumping into the vehicle to steer it off the road. The racers can take flight by passing over some squares scattered throughout the course. Pit-stops (presented as a house with a red sign painted on the roof and a "IN" sign painted on the track) are positioned at regular intervals beside the main track. Once inside them, a screen comes up with a choice of two shops where the candy can be spent:

? The one on the left is the Unusual Items Shop, that sells a variety of power-ups: extra lives, boosts for speed/jump/steering and extra time.

? The one on the right is the Relief Hospital, where the player can assess the damage and repair the vehicle.</synopsis>

Gameplay is viewed from just above and behind the car. The roads are full of sharp bends and hazards, contact with which can cause the car to roll and lose the player's time.

Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision! </synopsis>

The number of the dice the person is holding can be changed with the B button, pressing the A button will shoot the dice upwards. If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once.

There are three modes of play: The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Predator is a side-scrolling platformer which uses the imagery and characters from the classic Arnie movie of the same name. The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times.

The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all and must collect them as the game goes on.</synopsis>

You are a noble warrior who has just saved your kingdom from an invasion by the terrible Demon Lord. The grateful king offers you to choose any reward you wish for your brave deed. But instead of opting for half of the kingdom or the riches of the land, you ask the king for the permission to raise a poor little orphan girl named Maria. 

And so the game begins. You are the one who has to build Maria's future. Of course, you can do it in many ways. You can strive to make a real princess out of her, teach her good manners, study arts, to make her a brave fighter like yourself, or just a lazy bimbo who cares for nothing. Her destiny is in your hands!</synopsis>

      <title>Psy-O-Blade</title>
      <synopsis>In 21th century, there are three main powers on the Earth. The free world and the communist block carried over from the 20th century; the third power is the New Communist Federation. Since a program of denuclearizing was supported by all those powers, the New Communist Federation developed a devastating non-nuclear weapon: the satellite "Raiden". The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship "Septemius 1" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, "Racoon", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship "Septemius 2", was sent to investigate the strange disappearance. 

Psy-O-Blade is a Japanese adventure in anime style. The player interacts with the game world by moving a cursor and clicking on objects to examine or use them, and people to talk to them, or by choosing options ("Move" and "Scroll") from a menu. There are no puzzles to solve; the player advances in the game by talking to characters, visiting different locations, as well as examining and using objects.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A scientist and his two female assistants work on ESP research in a remote science laboratory. One day, a section of the lab blows up. It turned out that the monsters kept for experiments escaped and took one of the assistants with them. The scientist gives an "ESP booster" to the remaining assistant so she can go rescue her.

Your character possesses psychic power which she uses to blast away her enemies. You start the game with few powers and eventually gain more as items dropped by monsters are picked up. You control powers such as fire, ice, sonic waves, temporary invincibility, levitation, and more.</synopsis>

      <title>Puyo Puyo</title>
      <synopsis>Puyo Puyo is a falling pieces puzzle, with basic similarities to Tetris. Pairs of puyos (monsters from Compile's RPG series Mad? Monogatari)
fall down from the top into a cylinder. They can be moved left or right, rotated in either direction and made to drop faster. The goal is to get four puyos of the same color touching each other horizontally or vertically. Doing so removes them from the field. Making groups of larger than four, several at the same time or creating chain reactions nets more points. The game ends once the stacked puyos reach the top of the cylinder.

The game offers an endless single-player mode, a two-player mode (first player to fill their cylinder loses) and a mission mode. Mission mode presents the player with a number of pre-filled playing fields with a preset task, like making a minimum number of puyos disappear in one move, or removing all puyos of a certain color.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The object of Puzzle is to reassemble a picture which has been scrambled. The picture is broken into a number of pieces with one or more open spaces. Slide the pieces into the open spaces to rearrange them back into the proper order. If you're stuck, you have the option of challenging the computer to a game of chance like rock, paper, scissors or roll the dice. This will subtract 60 seconds from your time, but if won allows any two pieces on the board to be swapped. If you forget what the picture looks like, you can pause the game and see the completed version, but this can only be done five times per puzzle. There are eight different levels, plus two additional expert levels. </synopsis>

      <synopsis>In this game, you guide a marker which must draw rectangles and other weird objects in order to claim your territory, and you can either draw these rectangles fast or slow. Drawing the rectangles using the "slow" method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced "kicks"), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing. Once you have claimed enough territory, you proceed to the next level.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Quinpl is a japanese puzzle game of the King's Valley II and Eggerland Mystery variety. The main objective is to reach a exit door by jumping over and destroying blocks and monsters. The player's character can shoot stakes that kill the monsters and stick to the blocks (he can jump on these stakes and eventually break those blocks, clearing the path to the exit door). If he touches any of the monsters or dangerous environments, he transforms into a blue frog and the player loses one life. There are several items that can be collected: some of them are immobile, some randomly float around the screen.

On the top of the screen there are a inventory of collected items, a timer and the number of lives. Both the cartridge and disk versions allow saving the game between levels.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In this game the player takes the role of an ancient warrior who has been brought to life by the benevolent wizard Wart. It seems that the evil goddess Kardis is about to be resurrected by her faithful servants. The only way to stop them is to gather famous heroes from Lodoss War universe and to defeat the evil ones in a battle.

Record of Lodoss War is quite similar to  Diablo gameplay-wise. It is an action RPG which is heavily combat-oriented. You can directly control only the main hero, while the legendary heroes who join him on the quest are controlled by the AI. As you go through the game you level up, tweak your items with the great Ancients system, and gain new spells. It is also possible to forge weapons and to imbue them with runes. As your adventures into the surrounding land go on, you can return to your HQ, the Goblin Fortress, and get much needed healing and healing potions (free of charge).</synopsis>

      <synopsis>It is the 22nd century. Earth is invaded by a aliens, led by a gigantic robotic snake. To repel the attack, Earth's scientists construct the Replicart machine, a deadly robot snake. The player takes the role of the pilot of the Replicart.

Replicart is a single-player only Snake game variant. In each of the 300 stages you have to collect a certain amount of a substance called 'Biteslime'. Once you fulfill your quota you can enter the next stage through an exit that opens on the left side of the screen. Collecting biteslime increases the length of your snake. If the head of your snake hits a wall, an enemy or part of its body you lose a life.  Replicart enhances the basic Snake game formula by adding power ups like a Time Stop, which freezes enemies, speed increase/decrease or level warps.

The Famicom Disk System version has undergone a few changes. There are only 100 stages and after each 10 stages you have to face a boss, which must be shot down before continuing to the next set of stages.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>You play Rick Dangerous, an Indiana Jones type who's on a quest to find the lost Coolu Amazon tribe.  However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base.

Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.</synopsis>

The game concept is still the same, though they did improve a lot of features that one may consider 'disturbing' from RTK I (e.g. Generals dying easily due to disease, etc.). RTK can be said to be much more 'stable' where players no longer have to worry that much about time length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to build up their forces without much interference. The RTK II gameplay and interface is closely similar to Nobunaga's Ambition II.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Ryukyu is an unusual puzzle game produced by Ascii Corporation and published by Face. Decorated in a Hawaiian theme (actually, the game is probably based on the Japanese Ryukyu Islands), the game mixes together elements from various classic features with new ones - the most obvious being traditionnal Poker and Tetris. The game field is made of a uniform "five by five" grid. Playing cards are dropped from the top of the field and fill up these empty spaces. When a row, a column or a diagonal of five cards is filled, the game awards the player points for creating poker hands (card combinations) such as pairs, straights or flushes. The goal of the game is to gain the maximum amount of points and maybe achieve a perfect Clear. Ryukyu offers different play modes - solo modes often give the player an opportunity to reveal a picture with a cute girl in bikini made of mosaic tiles (if only they can manage to cleanup the field and unlock them all).</synopsis>

      <title>Seikima II Special</title>
      <synopsis>Players take control of Demon Kogure, a member of the real life Japanese heavy metal band Seikima-II. He is on a mission to rescue his fellow "demon" bandmates who have been captured and imprisoned by the God Zeus.

The game is broken up into four zones that are composed of eight areas each. In each area players have to collect all the visible items laying around to complete that area. Once all the items are collected in the seven areas of a zone, players can then enter the eighth area where they will find one of their bandmates locked inside a cage. While collecting all the visible items, players will be continuously attacked by enemies that they can either try to jump and dodge or shoot their projectile weapon at them. Getting hit by an enemy will decrease the players life, which is already constantly draining.

One of the items the player collects are moneybags. Collected moneybags earn the player money which can in turn be spent at the various shops found throughout the game. Shops sell life potions, stronger weapons, and also musical instruments for each band member.</synopsis>

You start the investigation at her house, where things take a dramatic turn when her housekeeper tells you that Yoshizawa's assistant and niece, Rika, hasn't left her room for the entire day. As you break the door, you find Rika dead on the floor. The madman has found his first victim...

Shadow Hunter is a graphical adventure game using principles common to Japanese adventures of its age, quite similar to Icom's adventures such as Déjà vu, where you have a graphical view occupying most of the screen, surrounded by a message box at the bottom and actions on the right. Unlike Icom's adventures, though, you cannot choose a verb on the right and then point a cursor on an object on the screen. Instead, ready-made actions are presented in an ad-hoc manner according to what is relevant to each screen. The game is filled with bad ends ? e.g. if you choose to stay at the hotel, the game is ended because you're wasting time.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Shanghai is one of the first video game adaptations of the tile-based game played with the Chinese mahjong stones - essentially a puzzle game that has little to do with real mahjong rules.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</synopsis>

      <title>Shiryou Sensen 2. War of the Dead 2</title>
      <synopsis>It's set some years after the incident in the first game (where Lila managed to avert a portal into hell consuming the whole world), and terrorists have targeted the industrial city of Sun Dorado.

The recently completed Keel Nuclear Power Plant has been taken over, and S-SWAT are tasked with handling the situation. Except as Lila (now promoted to Lieutenant) points out in the intro, why send in the Supernatural SWAT squad to deal with common terrorists? As the Chief reveals, they've found strange creatures in sewers - creatures not of this world, but from Hades (the other dimension in the first game), meaning whoever was behind the previous crisis is behind this one. What survivors remain are barricading themselves indoors. The city has been cordoned off and Lila is the prime candidate for the mission. So off she sets, with four fellow S-SWAT members, to regain control.

This sequel has undergone radical changes from the original, with all of the RPG trappings stripped out. There's no longer any kind of stats, menu system to navigate, day/night cycle, overworld map, or weapon recovery items. In fact the only items are drugs, which restore health to maximum and only one can be carried at a time, and key items with further the story. The biggest (and arguably best) change is the combat: there are no longer any random battles. Taking place on a series of massively sprawling maps, as opposed to shrunken JRPG-style maps which warp you to new maps when entering buildings, all enemies can be seen immediately. Furthermore you never fight more than a single enemy at a time. If there's something hostile in a new area, you can see his health bar at the bottom.

In a lot of ways it closely resembles the original Metal Gear, except more sedate and with greater emphasis on NPC dialogue.</synopsis>

      <title>Shiryou Sensen. War Of The Dead</title>
      <synopsis>Due to mysterious circumstances, a flourishing city called Chinese Hill was cut off the rest of the world. Investigators found out that most of the buildings were destroyed, horrifying creatures are roaming the wilderness, and the few survivors have no means of escaping. The SSWAT (Supernatural Special Weapon Attack Team) sends an agent named Laila to the city. The young woman has powerful psychic abilities, which can enhance her firearms, helping her deal with the monsters. She must rescue the survivors and escort them to safety, at any cost...

Shiryo Sensen - War of the Dead is an action game with slight RPG elements. The player navigates Laila over the top-down "world map": the ruined city has basically turned into large wilderness areas with a few buildings that are represented by icons on the map and can be explored. Enemies attack randomly. The battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully action-based. Laila can jump, duck, and attack with melee or weapons or firearms (which require ammunition). Typically there are several enemies on the screen; Laila escapes the battle if she reaches the end of the short side-scrolling area. 

The goal of the game is to find and rescue the few survivors trapped in the buildings infested by enemies. Laila has to bring these survivors back to the church. Even though the map is almost completely open to the player (especially after Laila acquires a boat, which makes the world fully explorable), the rescuing must be completed in a linear fashion, by talking to characters in different buildings and receiving clues. The game has a day/night cycle; Laila can sleep at any time, which will restore a portion of her health.</synopsis>

      <title>Star Virgin</title>
      <synopsis>Star Virgins about as obscure as it comes, its a promotional hour long straight to video film from Japan. That was made to promote a little seen videogame of the same name distributed by Activision that only ever appeared on the long forgotten msx system.

Plays out pretty much like a bonkers live action anime movie. Its a camp science fiction fantasy comedy about a girl whose secretly the lone fighter of justice Star Virgin, its her pursuit to stop the planet being attacked from robotic &amp; puppet monsters, giant spiders and whatever else would warrant as being an end of level boss in an 80s video game... at least I think thats the overall idea, because its obviously never been translated into English its hard to totally fathom out what the hells going on, but hey thats the beauty of the Japanese movies right.

Star Virgin herself is every Japanorama fanboys wetdream, shes a cute pink power ranger with her own spacecraft &amp; powerbike and she kicks ass with a bazooka. The whole thing would have made an awesome music video for The Flaming Lips - Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots (what I'm oddly playing while writing this). Sure its none essential throwaway stuff, but its a fun hour even without knowing what they're saying.

[Personal Reasons For Remembering]
Really loved the spacecraft scenes complete with their robotic butler drivers and its not every day I get to see a movie featuring a robotic Statue of Liberty and an evil genius who lives on a floating volcanic island.</synopsis>

      <title>Starship Rendezvous</title>
      <synopsis>This is an Adult game!

If you start the game from disk1, there are four levels, and you will walk around what looks like a hangar bay with space ships. There are various adult objects lying around that you can collect. At the end of a level there is a female "boss", and you get to use the adult objects on her. The gameplay is pretty laggy, and you can only shoot one bullet and need to wait until it has left the screen. The more enemies are on the screen the worse the lag becomes. Enemies don't notice you unless your in their direct line of view (straight in front), but they do see you through walls and will try to shoot you even though they cannot. Generally it is easiest to avoid them rather then shooting at them, with the exception of the female boss at the end of the level which you need to shoot to begin the "boss" game.

If you start the game directly from disk2, you will go straight to the "Special Stage Michelle", here you have a similar adult game as the "boss" game at the end of each level of disk1, without having to play the level. The main difference is that the "boss" game on disk1 is Japanese Anime style, the one on disk2 is based on photos, and the quality of the photos will depend on the MSX machines capability. For best quality a MSX2+ or TurboR should be used.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Strategic Mars is a shooter from dB-Soft. You start the game from player base, where you can buy upgrades when you get enough points from shooting enemies. At first you can upgrade your engine, repair the ship and get missiles which launch automatically against every enemy wave you face.

You navigate and warp to fight enemies from the map screen, which tells you the difficulty of the enemies. Fuchsia dots have the easiest enemies and red icons the hardest. Once you clear all enemies from the map, you move to the next level. There are 12 levels in total, and you can even start from the last level if you so wish from the start screen, no passwords needed.</synopsis>

      <title>Street Neo Fighter II - The World Warrior</title>
      <synopsis>In 2011, norakomi started working on a MSX2 version of Street Fighter 2. He successfully created a promising prototype in 2 months time. However for various reasons he never finished it and it was never shown to the public until last year's Barcelona RU. Footage and pictures found their way to the web and sparked the interest of many fans who tried convincing norakomi to resume the project. Some time later the decision was made that the game would be finished by another team.

Now, with less than 6 months until the deadline, Baka-Yo! Softcorp has decided to make it official, announcing "Pointless Fighting" as the very first entry of #msxdev Compo 2014! They certainly have their work cut out for them. The game will no doubt be highly anticipated and looks set to raise the bar on MSX2 development.

The current requirements for running this game are a MSX2 with 128kB RAM and a 4MB FlashROM, but in order to make the game accessible to more MSX users, these may be changed to 256kB RAM and MSX-DOS2. It will support keyboard and joysticks, including Joymega-adapter with Sega 6-button devices. MSX-MUSIC and MoonSound are also supported.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In the 12th century, the Emperor Hui Zhong is faced with an internal rebellion led by Imperial Minister Gao Qiu. The Song Dynasty comes to an end, and Gao Qiu became the new ruler. You take the role of an exiled ruler, and you must build your stats up to be able to challenge- and destroy- Gao Qiu and restore Hui Zhong to the throne.

The game is a military strategy game, like most of Koei's games, but instead of conquering a country, the goal is to depose the despotic ruler of China. You start out lowly, and have to work your way up by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles. You have to earn the right to attack Gao Qiu's home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.</synopsis>

      <title>Super Daisenryaku</title>
      <synopsis>Super Daisenryaku is one of the many titles in SystemSoft's long-running war strategy series. The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.

The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included  terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya),  to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members. 

Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.</synopsis>

The game takes place in the year 2042, 50 years after a disaster at Chernoton Laboratory released a deadly agent into the air that killed 80 percent of the Eurasian population. You're Gilian Seed, who was discovered in Siberia while in artificial sleep. Gilian wakes up with no memories. He wants to know more about his past, but the only clue he has to go on is a word that sounds eerily familiar: Snatcher.</synopsis>

      <title>Super Lode Runner</title>
      <synopsis>Between 1984 to 1986, Irem released four more different Lode Runner arcade games in Japan after the original arcade games release.  55 stages were culled from these arcade games and were packaged into Super Lode Runner for the Famicom Disk System. The game also kept the innovation from the arcade games of the two-player mode and brought in 15 stages for simultaneous action.

The game keeps the typical gameplay of the Lode Runner series. Players have to collect all the gold on the stage, while either avoiding or trapping the robotic guards who are constantly giving them chase. The game also features a level editor so players can create their own stages to play on.

A few months after this game was released, Super Lode Runner II was released which is similar to this game, only it included different stages from the arcade games. Also, this game shouldn't be confused with the MSX game with the same title. While in a similar situation as this game, it contains an entirely different set of stages to play.</synopsis>

You control Rambo from a top-down perspective as he explores the jungle looking for keys and avoiding enemy patrols, the keys allow you to unlock the many huts you will come across in the jungle and must be explored to release the P.O.W.s and gather weapons and munitions in order to raise some hell, as your trusty knife is not going to cut it against all those Vietnamese and Russian soldiers.</synopsis>

You need to pick up an object that resembles an American Football and be the first to cross the finish line. The other player needs to try to take the ball from you. For this you can hit and kick each other.

But on subsequent levels you will need to avoid varies enemies and use your hitting and kicking to break blocks that are in your way. The blocks can fall on your head which stuns you for a few seconds, likewise if you get hit by an enemy. Get hit too often and you die.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Real-Time Role Playing Adventure game.

The game is a big maze where you need to find objects, primary amongst them seem to be bottles of different colours. The game is laggy, in particular when wielding your weapon. Enemies in the first couple of screens don't seem to do you any real harm. You can kill them typically with a single hit, and you can even walk over them. Killing enemies gives you experience (EXP), and when your experience bar is full your life bar increases (H.P). After a few screens though the enemies suddenly get a lot tougher and can kill you almost immediately.</synopsis>

      <title>Taiyou No Shinden - Asteka 2</title>
      <synopsis>Despite its name (a misspelling of Azteca), the story of Taiyo no Shinden: Asteka II is dedicated to the Maya people, indigenous inhabitants of Southern Mexico and Central America, rather than the Aztecs. The player controls a nameless adventurer who searches for the Sun Key, a mysterious ancient artifact which can unlock the secrets of the Mayan civilization.

Taiyo no Shinden: Asteka II is an adventure game which takes place in the ruins of the ancient city Chichen Itza on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. There is a top-down overworld on which the player can physically navigate the protagonist, entering temples and other locations. In such locations, the view switches to first-person perspective. The player interacts with the environment by selecting various verb commands ("Look", "Take", "Use", etc.), represented by icons, from a menu, and combining them with objects on the screen. In spite of its Japanese origins, the game features inventory item usage and puzzle-solving, which are more typical of Western-style adventures.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Kazumi Kinoshita and Sanae Kanazawa are two high school girls who go on a school trip together with their classmates. Shortly after their arrival at the camp dormitory, various girls become targeted by unknown assailants. In order to solve the mystery the two heroines must talk to their classmates, collect clues, and eventually find the culprits.

Abunai Tengu Densetsu is an adventure game with menu-based navigation and input. Most screens offer a fairly long list of verb commands, some of which must be combined with objects or persons selected from a sub-menu in order to interact with the environment. The game allows the player to visit many different rooms and other locations in any order; however, certain events must be triggered in order to advance, sometimes by repeatedly selecting commands. Certain situations require the player to find items and use them in a different location. The game contains scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.</synopsis>

      <title>Testament</title>
      <synopsis>The continent of Diodoran is ruled by five dragons residing in the Dark Sky. One day, a horde of monsters invaded the continent and as a result the city of Rastram sunk below the surface of the sea. One intrepid adventurer who actually believed that myth ventured into the ruins, determined to find out what exactly happened, but was met with fierce opposition from the monstrous dwellers.

Testament is a top-down shooter. The player navigates the protagonist through fairly complex, maze-like stages, shooting at constantly appearing monsters. Shields and grenades can be found along the way, as well as food (such as hamburgers) that restores the hero's health. A map for each stage can be acquired in a certain location within, facilitating the task of finding the exit.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The original commercially-licensed version of Alexey Pajitnov's classic Tetris puzzle game.  Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears.  If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over.  Difficulty increases by dropping the pieces faster and faster over time.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The Forbidden Tower is a sequel to The Sign of Chaos and is the third game in the Tir-nan-óg series of role-playing games based on Irish myths. The plot continues the events of the previous game, as the legendary hero and the princess of Fianapia travel to the land of Serokyu, the fifth kingdom that became affected by the ensuing chaos as the light of the ancient goddess Dana began to fade away. Visually and gameplay-wise the game is almost identical to its immediate predecessor, offering the same Ultima-like mechanics with open-ended exploration and tactical turn-based combat. Changes are mostly cosmetic, such as graphical images for individual locations in towns. </synopsis>

      <title>Topple Zip</title>
      <synopsis>Topple Zip is a vertically scrolling shooter that is marketed as a racing game. The basic premise is that you control an aircraft and fly in competition against several other, computer controlled crafts. In addition to shooting at your opponents, you may ram into them, and they into you. Doing so may dislodge a pill shaped power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect. 

Power-ups exist in various types, including defensive and offensive such as giving you better weapons. There are eight different levels, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other levels. How the levels connect is random each time you play the game. 

The goal of the game is to locate a key which is necessary to access the warp which leads to the eight and final level. Collect it from whichever level it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth level before any of your competitors.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Once again, demons are threatening the peaceful existence of the human kind. The evil Geld is sending his army to conquer human lands. Legend says that the ancient city of Seram harbors a mysterious jewel that is needed to defeat Geld. But who is brave enough to venture there and retrieve it?

The follow-up to Tritorn is, like its predecessor, an action role-playing game. It expands upon the previous game by adding friendly areas (towns), monetary system, shops that sell items, magic spells, weapons, and armor, and non-player characters to interact with. The player takes the roles of various adventurers belonging to different classes; they are, however, controlled very similarly, with a single button assigned to attack. It is also possible to jump and climb ladders, though there are no true platforming elements in the game. Experience points and money are awarded for defeating enemies.</synopsis>

      <title>Ultima IV - Quest of the Avatar</title>
      <synopsis>Following the defeat of the evil triad in the previous three Ultima games, the world of Sosaria changed beyond recognition: continents rose and sank, and new cities were built, heralding the advent of a different civilization. Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.

The fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them. 

Instead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first "true" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.

Character creation is done by choosing responses to morally ambiguous questions. Each of the Eight Virtues corresponds to a character class; by determining the player's personal priorities in the virtues, the game assigns a class and a starting location for the Avatar. After emerging in Britannia, the player is free to explore it in various ways (on foot, moongate teleportation, on horseback, by ship, etc.). Certain items must be collected in any order to enter the Stygian Abyss and complete the game. The Avatar also has to reach the highest level in all virtues. This is achieved by various means: donating blood increases Sacrifice, not fleeing from combat increases Valor, etc. The process, however, is not irreversible: should the Avatar overpay a blind seller, he gains Compassion points; should he, on the other hand, cheat the seller by underpaying, his level in several virtues would decrease.

These unorthodox features of the game co-exist with plenty of traditional RPG elements, such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill. Enemies are encountered on the world map as well as in dungeons; combat takes place on separate top-down screens, allowing player-controlled and enemy parties freely move on them. Characters accumulate experience points and level up, gaining higher amount of hit points and access to stronger magic spells. Like in the previous installments of the series, world map, town exploration and combat are presented from a top-down view, while the dungeons are pseudo-3D and are explored from first-person perspective.

Ultima IV also introduces several new gameplay features to the series and role-playing games in general. A number of initially non-playable characters living in various areas of the game world are able to to join the party and fight alongside the hero, replacing traditional player-generated characters or mercenaries and adventurers available only in special locations. Additional new elements include buying and combining reagents in order to cast spells, unique items such as grapple to pass through mountains, puzzle rooms in dungeons, and others.

The FM Towns version, while identical to the others in gameplay, introduces upgraded graphics similar to those used in next installment of the series.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A quality fantasy-themed vertical shooter with RPG elements, the game let's you choose among three distinct characters.
The warrior is good at throwing axes and knives and can use his shield for protection from bullets.
The wizard excels in the manipulation of elemental spirits and Ice and can perform an invisibility / invincibility spell to dodge bullets (but not enemies). While using the spell, he can't move though.
Finally, the female-ninja is specialized in using Fire and the Boomerang and she has the ability to jump. The choice of the character is really important because each plays very differently and each should have a dedicated ending sequence.</synopsis>

      <title>Valis - The Fantasm Soldier II</title>
      <synopsis>Rogles, the tyrant who wanted to gain control over the three worlds in the universe, was defeated by Yuko, an ordinary Japanese teenager who was chosen to become the heroic Valis Soldier.  The dream world Vecanti fell into the hands of Emperor Megas. Driven by intense hatred to Rogles and his followers, Megas became an even more dangerous fanatic, imposing an iron rule on his realm. Yuko must now travel to the dream world and defeat the new tyrant and his minions.

Like its predecessor, Mugen Senshi Valis II is an action platformer. Yuko fights and jumps her way through enemies and platform structures, acquiring various power-ups during the course of the game. Various weapons and armor can be found in the stages and equipped on a separate screen. Weapons have their own unique ranged patterns and are always attached to Yuko's default sword attack. Different types of armor may increase Yuko's hit points, offense, and defense ratings. 

Yuko can also acquire and execute special attacks and techniques, such as for example an ability that freezes all the enemies on screen for a limited amount of time. These deplete a separate bar that can be filled by collecting colored orbs left by enemies. Two of the six stages control like side-scrolling shoot-em-ups, allowing Yuko to fly in any direction.

The Sharp X68000 version features improved graphics, voice acting during the intro, reduced difficulty level (particularly for boss battles), and allows the player to save the game between the stages.</synopsis>

      <title>Vampire Killer</title>
      <synopsis>You are young Simon, who has just entered Dracula's Satanic Castle.
The world of Dransylvania is in trouble, and you are the one to set it right. You have to fight your way through 18 stages of demons to where Dracula is hiding. Once you have destroyed Dracula, the evil force behind all the trouble will show up, attempting to destroy you! Destroy this menace, and Dransylvania will return to it's happy days after a wait of hundreds of years.

Vampire Killer follows the same plot as Castlevania, but with a different gameplay. At each stage, Simon has to find a white key to open the exit door which leads to the next stage. The keys are usually hidden in the castle's walls, in which he will also find useful items. Items can also be found by whipping candles and other sources of light inside the castle.

Among the items which can be found are:
Gold Cross: wipes out all enemies;
Silver Cross: prevent enemies from appearing for a short time;
Sapphire Ring: renders Simon invincible for a short time;
Blue Crystal: renders Simon invisible for a short time;
Yellow Key: is used to open chests containing items;
Candle: highlights destructible walls; 
Map: can be used up to three times and shows Simon location n the castle;
Red Book: increases item's prices;
White Book: decreases item's prices
Tan Shield: blocks enemy attacks;
Red Shield: reduces damage upon enemy contact;
Boots: make Simon walk faster;
Wings: make Simon jump higher;
Holy Water: a secondary weapon, which uses hearts as ammunition;
Hourglass: stops enemy movement for a short time, consuming hearts.
Hearts are both a kind of ammunition and currency in the game. They can be found by whipping candles or killing enemies. They are used for buying items from the Old Crone and as ammo for the Holy Water and the Hourglass.

Simon can also find several primary weapons in the game, such as whip upgrades, a throwing dagger, an axe and a cross. Differently from Castlevania, the dagger, axe and cross replace the whip and do not use hearts as ammo.</synopsis>

The game features three unrelated episodes, each focusing on a different character, and each with multiple endings... though none of them could really be described as "good". The game proceeds mostly in standard adventure game style style, with the only real interaction being dialogue choices or clicking on objects to investigate them, though there are a handful of minigames sprinkled throughout that will also affect the story outcome.</synopsis>

      <title>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</title>
      <synopsis>The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process.

The first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might &amp; Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre.

The player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.</synopsis>

      <title>Woody Poco</title>
      <synopsis>Woody Poco is a side-scrolling action role-playing game similar to Mystical Ninja.

The player controls an old wooden figure named "Poco." He is a hero who has lived in harmony with humans for many years. For Poco, the journey is to find the fairy who teaches people to get back to being friendly with wooden dolls. Enemies encountered through the game are strange creatures and bothersome old men. The player attacks by using his fists at them. Players can steal the items in the store. But after stealing, the player's appearance is changed to resemble that of a thief. Hotels and pawn shops can no longer admit the player for the remainder of the game after a theft has taken place.

The player can equip one hand with a weapon, and the other with a passive tool, such as a lamp for dark areas. The player can buy gear, sleep at hotels, gamble, steal, and bribe non-player characters. The player needs to eat to prevent hunger, with recharging health based on food level. It features an in-game clock, with day/night cycles and four seasons; the color changes to reflect the time of day and the season.</synopsis>

      <title>Xak - The Art of Visual Stage</title>
      <synopsis>Xak: The Art of Visual Stage (ãµã¼ã¯) is the first game in the fantasy role-playing video game series Xak developed and published by Micro Cabin. It was originally released for the NEC PC-8801 computer system, with subsequent versions being developed for the NEC PC-9801, Sharp X68000, MSX2, PC-Engine, Super Famicom, and mobile phones. The first four versions were re-released for Windows on online store Project EGG. An English translation of Xak: The Art of Visual Stage was also released in 2007 on the now-defunct retro gaming service WOOMB.net, and is now to become available on Project EGG.

Xak: The Art of Visual Stage features a typical high fantasy setting. According to the game world's legends, a great war was fought between the benevolent but weakening ancient gods and a demon race, which led to the collapse and eventual mortality of the gods. After this 'War of Sealing', the gods divided the world into three parts: Xak, the world of humans, Oceanity, the world of faeries, and Xexis, the world of demons. The demon world of Xexis was tightly sealed from the other two worlds as to prevent reentry of the warmongering demon race. Some demons were left behind in Xak, however, and others managed to discover a separate means to enter Xak from Xexis anyway. This ancient history is displayed in the introduction of Xak II.

One of them, Badu, was a very powerful demon, able to use coercive magic to make humans do his bidding. Duel, the god of war, managed to defeat Badu and seal him away in a mountain of ice for 250 years. The god later settled in a village known as Fearless to live out the rest of his mortal life.

At the beginning of the game, Badu's prison is broken. Demons overrun parts of Xak once again. In order to stop the ravaging of his lands, the King of Wavis sends a messenger faerie to Dork Kart, a famous warrior living in the village of Fearless. Dork, however, has gone missing. The player takes on the role of Latok Kart, Dork's 16-year-old son, as he meets the messenger faerie, Pixie. Latok embarks on the King's quest to slay Badu, hoping to find his father along the way.

In his travels, Latok is guided by Duel's spirit. Over the course of the game, it turns out that Dork and thus Latok is a descendant of Duel. (Wikipedia)</synopsis>

      <title>Xak II - The Rising of the Red Moon</title>
      <synopsis>Xak II: Rising of the Redmoon is a fantasy role-playing video game developed and published by the Japanese software developer MicroCabin. It is a direct sequel to Xak: The Art of Visual Stage (Xak I). The game was released in Japan only, but due to an MSX scene that arose in Europe (predominately in the Netherlands region) some of the MSX versions of Xak received fan translations. An enhanced remake was later released for the NEC PC-Engine, together with the first game in the series Xak as Xak I &amp; II by Telenet Japan's development team Riot.

Xak II, being a direct sequel to the first game in the series, it features the same high fantasy setting as Xak. The gods' division of the world into Xak, the world of men, Oceanity, the world faeries, and Xexis, the world of demons, as referenced in Xak, is depicted in this game's introduction. In this adventure, the main hero of the Xak series, Latok Kart is exploring a vast region situated around a single central village of Banuwa.

In Xak, the protagonist Latok Kart fought and defeated the demon Zemu Badu. One of Badu's minions escaped, a black-robed man known only as Necromancer. Three years later, Necromancer is able to contact one of his allies from the demon world of Xexis: a fearsome demon called Zamu Gospel. Following a prophecy foretold by an ancient and extremely powerful sorcerer by the name of Amadok, the Necromancer and three other demons (referred to as Demonlords) are attempting to complete a dark ritual which will revive Zamu Gospel into the world of Xak.

The player once again controls Latok, now nineteen years of age. A rumour about the whereabouts of Latok's father Dork has surfaced around the village of Banuwa. Latok and his faerie companion Pixie travel to the village to investigate, but soon run into Gospel's minions. (Wikipedia)</synopsis>

      <title>Xak III - The Tower of Gazzel</title>
      <synopsis>The events of this game take place shortly after the hero Latok defeated the demon Gospel in Xak II: The Rising of the Redmoon. Latok hears rumors about a man who looks exactly like him and was last seen near an old tower infested by monsters, which nobody dares enter. Latok and his girlfriend Fray arrive at the tower entrance and meet their friends there. Latok decides to venture into the tower with just one companion, unaware of the fact that the "false Latok" was just a trap set by powerful demons, intended to lure him into the den of evil.

Xak Precious Package: The Tower of Gazzel is a side-story in the Xak universe. It differs from the main Xak series in several gameplay-related aspects, even though graphically it is very similar to the previous Xak games. Most importantly, Tower of Gazzel is not an RPG: Latok begins the game with maximized parameters and can not become stronger. The combat is similar to other Xak games: Latok attacks enemies with a sword in real time, and receives damage when they touch him. Tower of Gazzel is much more oriented towards puzzle-solving than the previous games. The entire game takes place in the tower, which is a huge maze containing various obstacles that the player must find solutions for (locked doors, seemingly impassable areas, etc.). Latok can jump over some dangerous spots (such as poisonous puddles). An important gameplay element is Latok's companion. Each of the four available companions has a different ability: for example, Fray can cast spells, Pixie can handle certain mechanisms in the tower, etc. In order to solve many of the puzzles, it is necessary to bring the right companion to the spot and let her take care of the problem.(Moby Games)</synopsis>

      <title>Xevious - Fardraut Saga</title>
      <synopsis>Xevious: Fardraut Saga is a vertically-scrolling shooter that contains two modes: Recon and Scramble. The Recon mode is a port of the arcade game Xevious; the Scramble mode can be considered its sequel, adding sixteen new stages, enemies, and boss battles, as the brave fighter pilots continue to defend the Earth against its former inhabitants, who migrated to the planet Xevious thousands of years ago and are now determined to re-capture their ancestral homeland.

The game's Scramble mode allows the player to control three other aircrafts in addition to the seris' trademark Solvalou, each possessing unique weapons. These aircrafts include Solgrado (armed with spread shot), Zeodalley (twin back fire), and Gampmission, a large ship that is also a combination of the previous three, with massive firepower and enhanced lock-on abilities. A specific aircraft can be assigned to each of the player's "lives". The amount of points needed to gather an extra life increases if the player selects more powerful ships. Also, enemies become progressively harder as the controlled aircraft collects power-ups.</synopsis>

      <title>XZR</title>
      <synopsis>It is the 12th century, and the Muslim world has been split into two warring factions. Meanwhile, Muhammad's disciples are also threatened external forces ? in the west the Crusaders; in the east the Mongols. As the Persian assassin Sadler, you are given the task of murdering the Caliph, hopefully saving the future of the Islamic faith in the process, a process which will have implications ranging as far as 800 years into the future. First, however, you must find your three assassin friends and complete a range of quests, for this is an RPG.

Like many of Falcom's games, XZR (or Exile, as it is pronounced) is played in a traditional top-down view when in villages and towns, and shifts to a side-scrolling platform view when entering dungeons, castles and other action sequences. Apart from equipping your character with an arsenal of weapons and clothes in order to raise hit points and attack points, you can also quaff potions to boost your points. Mind you, these are not ordinary magical potions, but heavy drugs such as hashish, cocaine, LSD, and heroin. The effect of the drugs only lasts a short while, and too liberal usage of the narcotics will corrupt the screen, or even kill you.

Even though your party is made up of as many as four characters, only Sadler can be controlled; others do as they want and must be retrieved once they wander off to finish their specialised tasks. All battles are fought alone as well. Though magic can be used, it is seldom as strong or useful as hand-to-hand combat.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The city of Palma has always been protected by the spirits of the four elements. However, Dolgo, the spirit of the earth, revolts and makes off with the Life Seeker, the controller of the world's life energies, to his underground lair. In doing so, the people of Palma begin to lose their very souls. The spirit of the air has ordered that a champion needs to be found, to retrieve the Life Seeker from the clutches of Dolgo. You are that champion.

Zombie Hunter is an action role-playing game, somewhat similar to Zelda II with its side-scrolling battles. You receive experience from defeating your enemies and you have an inventory complete with armor and weapons.</synopsis>
