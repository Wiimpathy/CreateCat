      <title>2 Shot Diary</title>
      <synopsis>2 Shot Diary is a collection of twelve short episodes of sexual nature, each told by a different young woman, presented as entries in their diaries. There is no connection between the stories. Each heroine has a different profession and social status (high school student, nurse, model, etc.), where each episode usually centers around a particular sexual theme (voyeurism, lesbian sex, rape, etc.). The game is almost entirely pornographic, with nearly each screen being a depiction of a sexual activity.

The game may be considered a visual novel, because no skill whatsoever is required to play the game and most of it is composed of text accompanied by pictures rather than interaction. Instead of making decisions, characteristically for most visual novels, the player chooses words from a menu to insert into the text. If the choice makes no sense, it simply disappears and the player chooses another one.</synopsis>

      <title>2 Shot Diary 2 4-4</title>
      <synopsis>This is the last of the four episodic games that constitute the sequel to  first 2 Shot Diary game. Unlike the first game with its 12 different scenarios, it only contains 2, and both are very short; however (also unlike the first game), most of the scenes here are animated. Both scenarios consist entirely of depictions of explicit sex.

One of the two scenarios depicts a meeting between Kaori, a successful OL ("office lady"), and her boyfriend. The two have sex, liberally utilizing vegetables for their intimate purposes...

The other scenario tells the story of Ayaka, a young girl who goes to a Catholic school. What she experiences there is not what she had expected: she becomes victim of sexual abuse and torture...

The gameplay follows the same template that was utilized in 2 Shot Diary: text and graphical scenes unfold automatically, and the player's input is restricted to choosing words from a list to fill blanks in sentences. This allows the player to interpret the events in various ways, effectively "writing" the girl's diary on his own.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Ace of Spades is a casino game with a gruesome twist. The player competes against female opponents in poker or blackjack; every victory leads to an explicit scene of sexual torture. The main mode includes a series of matches and subsequent sadistic scenes against various women. It is also possible to play poker or blackjack straight from the main menu, bypassing all these scenes. Both blackjack and poker rules are simplified: there is no betting, and the player with a better hand wins automatically.</synopsis>

      <title>Advanced Power Dolls 2</title>
      <synopsis>Advanced Power Dolls 2 is, like other installments in the series, a sci-fi mecha-themed turn-based tactical game. Visually and gameplay-wise it is nearly identical to Power Dolls 2 and Power Dolls 2 Dash, though without the selectable difficulty level of the latter. It introduces three new campaigns which depict a renewed struggle between the governments of Omni and Earth after an attempt at peaceful reconciliation by Omni was foiled. There is a greater number of selectable characters and specific vehicle requirements (types of planes, helicopters, etc.) for certain missions.</synopsis>

      <title>Alaskan Malamute G.C.</title>
      <synopsis>Alaskan malamute is actually a dog breed (similar to Siberian husky); but this game has nothing to do with dogs and everything to do with golf. The introduction story tells us that in 1912, the famous American businessman J.P.Morgan founded a golf tournament in Alaska. The best golfers from all over the world came to compete, but nobody from Japan... so naturally, the player has to correct that!

Referring to itself as a "3D simulation golf game", Alaskan Malamute G.C. features pseudo-3D terrain with rotatable camera. The player is able to adjust his golfer's position, strength, direction, and style of the shot. It is possible to create own players with different statistics. The game has various play modes, with up to 4 players competing in each; those modes include regular play, tournament, and training.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Trouble is in the kingdom of Stellar. The lovely princess has disappeared, and the king sends his best men to investigate. All they find on the spot where the princess has vanished is a confused young boy who has lost his memory and knows only his name: Liann. Since he still might have some connection to the princess' disappearance, the king sends Liann on a quest to find her. And perhaps along the way, the boy will be able to find the magic flower called Amaranth, that restores people's memories...

Amaranth is a RPG with action-based combat. Enemies appear randomly, and Liann and his party members are taken to a separate battle screen. Attacks are performed by bumping into enemies, like in  Ys series. The other party members are controlled by the AI. Equipment and items can be bought in town shops, and the heroes level up in a standard RPG fashion. </synopsis>

      <title>Amaranth III</title>
      <synopsis>Amaranth III directly continues the story of the  second game. The knight Lyann Fremdes and his lovely companion, the elf Din, the heroes of the game, head to the city of Dematria, where Din is met with joy; there is even an article about her magical healing powers in a local newspaper. All goes well till the heroes decide to visit the city Magnelia. A hostile army invades the train station and massacres people. Looks like Lyann and Din have to hide for the time being, before they can think of a secure way to stop the enemies - which is anything but easy, since the enemy seems to possess advanced technology...

Amaranth III differs from its  predecessors in several ways. It has a more modern setting, with steam-punk elements. The gameplay system has been re-vamped, becoming closer to a strategy RPG than to an action RPG. As before, the battles feature free movement, but it is turn-based now, with action points for each characters; the character can act as long as he/she still have action points left. There is a "Vigour" system that keeps track of characters' stamina; once the vigour is lowered, the character begins to lose hit points. Using special items and resting in inns restores vigour. 

The game also makes a step towards strategy RPGs by focusing less on exploration and more on pre-set, story-dictated battles. However, the small number of controllable characters and the ability to explore prevents it from being a full-fledged strategy RPG.</synopsis>

    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Amaranth IV</title>
      <synopsis>Amaranth IV continues the over-arching story of the  series. The main heroine in this game is not Liann Fremdes, the usual protagonist of Amaranth games, but his lovely elf companion Din. After visiting the ancient city of Posse and meeting some new friends, Din heads to the capital city of Stellar to meet prince Deinass, whom she helped eight years ago during events described in the  previous game. But shadows from the past keep haunting the young prince. His sister is kidnapped by an old acquaintance. Din, Deinass, and their friends must do everything they can to bring her back and to stop a new threat to the kingdom.

Similarly to the previous game, Amaranth IV contains elements of strategy RPGs: limited exploration, rare and story-dictated battles, and turn-based combat with free movement on the battle field. However, it gets rid of the "vigour" and action points system of the previous game, in favor of simpler gameplay. The player-controlled characters act in turns, and can usually move and execute a physical attack (or cast a spell) one time per turn. Some weapons require specific placement on the field (for example, bows require a character equipped with them to stand diagonally across the enemy in order to be able to attack). Character receive experience points and level up after defeating enemies; fallen character are resurrected to full health after battles. Instead of the usual top-down view, Amaranth IV uses isometric perspective for battles and exploration.</synopsis>

    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Amaranth KH</title>
      <genre>Role-Playing,Strategy</genre>
      <synopsis>Amaranth KH is a side-story in the Amaranth series, and can be considered a prequel to all the previous games; it doesn't feature the same heroes, but is set in the same universe, at a much earlier time, when the kingdom of Stellar was not yet built and when Posse was a flourishing city. The game tells the story of Landschaft, a young warrior in the army or Rauschritt. He trains in the Posse camp with his best friend Dienstag and the lovely Jungfer. He is well-known for his courage, but he first needs to prove himself worthy of being a true night. It began as an educational battle for the young hero, but soon a chain of events forced him to fight for his life and for his country.

Amaranth KH is the radical conclusion to the series' tendency to strategy elements; it discards the RPG elements (movement outside of a battle screen, exploration, etc.) in favor of a traditional Japanese-style turn-based strategy game with a RPG angle (leveling up). The player commands Landschaft, his friends, and their units, moving them on the battle screen and attacking enemies when they are in their weapons' range. There are different types of units: infantry, cavalry, archers, magicians, etc. Some battle elements were taken from the previous game (such as archers attacking diagonally). Strong, story-related characters (generals) can fight alone against an entire unit of "nameless" characters. Every attack is displayed as a separate picture, graphically depicting ts results. If the attack is initiated by the enemy, the player can choose to counter-attack.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The year is 1999. All over the world, excitement grows as the next millennium approaches. For the ordinary Japanese teenager Masa it doesn't mean that much. But very soon he discovers that he was wrong. At the turn of the millennium, ancient prophecies are being fulfilled. The advent of the Messiah is near, and the forces of darkness send their minions to corrupt and enslave the world. They have infiltrated Masa's high school as well. With the help of the exchange student Sophia, who is in fact an angel in human form, Masa must stop the evil...

Angel Halo is a visual novel: the entire game is composed of text and still graphical images, with an occasional choice to make. The choices lead to various CG pictures, as well as different endings. The game contains explicit nudity and sexual scenes.</synopsis>

      <title>Angel Hearts</title>
      <synopsis>In a certain girls' high school, students have begun to mysteriously disappear. Authorities suggest that a secret society is at work. A spy needs to be sent in order to solve the mystery, and this mission falls into the hands of this game's hero. His boss explains to him that the quest is dangerous, indeed: many students associated with the mysterious cult have gone rampant and will attack any trespasser on sight!..

This simple story is the background for an (equally) simple RPG. The gameplay resembles that of "dungeon crawlers", meaning that there are no friendly areas; though the view for exploration is top-down rather than first-person (which is reserved for the turn-based battles). The gameplay mechanics are mostly confined to fighting random enemies and earning enough experience points to go up a level and standing a chance against the next "boss" enemy. There is no equipment system, and battle commands are restricted to "Attack", "Escape", and "Item". 

The enemies are all pretty high school girls, and they undress upon defeat or even perform acts of sexual nature on the protagonist.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In the future, advanced genetic studies opened unseen possibilities for mankind. After years of research, it finally became possible to create artificial human beings with animal traits, the so-called deminoids. The player takes the role of the head of a detective agency named Armist; two pretty female deminoids (with bunny and cat ears) are his trustworthy partners. Investigating a murder in a huge deminoid-producing company, the hero will eventually discover the truth about this scientific achievement and all its implications...

Armist is a Japanese-style adventure, with still screens as locations and menu-based command input. Typically, the player has to exhaust all the options in every location to advance the plot. Commands mostly include examining objects in rooms and sharing opinions with the two partners. Conveniently, commands that do not lead to a new text message any more are removed from the menu, so that the player can concentrate on the others.</synopsis>

Ing escaped, knowing that Notos was probably killed by the monsters. Tortured by his conscience, Ing is found by a local young girl named Luna. But soon Luna and other young village girls mysteriously disappear, and Ing decides to help them however he can - not forgetting his quest for revenge against the snake...

Despite this RPG-like plot, the game is strictly a Japanese-style adventure. At every given screen, there are the standard Look, Talk, and Think commands. It is typically required to go through all the commands multiple times, obtaining the "Move" command and advancing the story.</synopsis>

      <title>Ayumi-chan Monogatari</title>
      <synopsis>The premise of Ayumi-chan Monogatari is rather simple: the protagonist, a young boy named Kouichi, is in love with the most beautiful girl in his school, Ayumi Kawai. One day she admits that she also loves him, and they begin a relationship.

The game starts when the two are already together, and is dedicated entirely to their dates - which consist mostly of sex. The game can be therefore considered a basic dating/sex simulation. Kouichi and Ayumi meet everyday, and the player, controlling Kouichi, can sometimes decide where they go - though the interaction is quite limited. The player can also choose sex-related commands during the intimate part of their date, raising Ayumi's pleasure meter and unlocking new pictures.</synopsis>

      <title>Balance of Power</title>
      <synopsis>The year is 1986. You take on the role of the US President or the Russian General Secretary. You have the full industrial capacity, covert forces, and military might of your country at your command. Your job? To make your country the world's most powerful and prestigious over the course of your eight years in office. Sounds easy, doesn't it? It would be if the other guy didn't have his finger poised over a red button that could wipe out the world! 

You must use diplomacy, make treaties, issue risky, covert CIA or KGB actions, or riskier, direct military intervention to prop up third world countries or help their insurgents and win them to your governmental philosophy: Capitalism or Communism. The world is a big place... and the other guy could start a nuclear war over a country as tiny as Tunisia. This game is the ultimate Cold War simulation. Every action requires careful analysis and the ability to judge your opponent (computer or human) and his reaction. The game features 62 countries, each carefully researched with up to date (as of 1985) information regarding their government, demographics, resources, etc.  </synopsis>

      <title>Ballade for Maria</title>
      <synopsis>In Ballade For Maria the player controls Jake Spikes, a detective from New York. Recently, terrible murders have been happening in Boston. An unknown killer seeks out women and brutally murders them, cutting their hands off. Jake travels to Boston to unravel the mystery, finding out who is responsible for the murders.

This is a Japanese-style adventure game. The game is viewed from first-person perspective, and the player interacts with the environment by selecting menu choices. Most of the gameplay involves talking to suspects. Unlike many other Japanese adventures, in Ballade For Maria it is possible to select many different topics when talking to people, and the information they provide allows the player to make conclusions and advance in the game. The game features nudity and horror scenes.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Birthdays is a dating simulation game. The goal of the game is to successfully date a girl of the player's choice. The player first chooses a birthday and a name for his alter ego. Then he is presented with a calendar for the year. Visiting different locations (movies, shopping mall, etc.) leads to meetings with different girls. After learning their phone numbers, it becomes possible to call them and set a date. During dates, the player often has to choose between different dialogue lines to please the girl. It is also possible to buy present for the ladies. It is entirely possible to set dates with multiple girls, but they might meet each other and become jealous. Girls also don't take it lightly if you don't appear on a date. Finally, at the protagonist's next birthday, the most impressed girl will agree to have sex with him. The sex scenes are explicit, but rather few.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The spaceship "Triant II", carrying an all-female crew under the command of Rachel Hugett, was attacked by mysterious aliens. The captain ordered to fire the strongest weapons, but nothing could help: the aliens invaded the ship...

...and in a unique twist, the player has to control an alien. No information is given about this playable character, that looks like a red crab. It starts at level 1, at the point where it invaded the ship. The game plays like a first-person dungeon crawler (this time the word "crawler" taken quite literally!). The alien moves through the pseudo-3D corridors of the ship. Crew members, robots and machines appear randomly and try to stop it. The battles are turn-based. The alien has two primary kinds of attacks at its disposal: physical attack (with its claw), and electricity attack. Defeating enemies brings experience points, leveling up the creature.</synopsis>

      <title>Bomber Quest</title>
      <synopsis>A young man named Shounosuke sees a strange dream: a voice talks about mankind and its sins, and a beautiful girl begs him to save her... The next day, when he goes to school, an earthquake occurs, and he is miraculously taken into another world, where he meets the girl from his dreams. She says that girls in different dimensions are in grave danger, and Shounosuke has to save them...

Bomber Quest has elements of both strategy/puzzle game and RPG. Each of the six girls has a different scenario, accessible from the beginning. Each scenario puts the player character into a top-down environment. Shounosuke has to build a maze to access its locations. The maze is built from small pieces taken from  Tetris. The player can rotate the pieces and then place them onto the ground. The goal is to build a maze that would cover possibly large ground, gaining access to important locations and items. Visiting uncovered locations in the right order leads to cut scenes, which advance the plot. 

Shounosuke will be randomly attacked by enemies during his wanderings through the mazes. The battles are viewed from first-person perspective and are turn-based. Shounosuke can only use physical attacks and items. Defeating enemies brings experience points, leveling Shounosuke up in a standard RPG fashion.

The game features scenes with nudity and sexual content.</synopsis>

      <title>Brandish VT</title>
      <synopsis>Somewhere in the desert of Kalua, in the country of Suelang, stands a huge tower. This is the Tower of Fata Morgana. Legends say that powerful ancient wisdom is hidden in this tower. But no one dares to venture in, fearing ferocious monsters and deadly traps. Three people, however, are exception to this rule: the young thief Dee, who hopes to steal treasure from the tower; the lovely elf witch Clare, who needs to discover ancient magic; and finally, a mysterious man named Quien, who doesn't remember his past and works as a mercenary...

Brandish VT is the fourth installment of the  Brandish series. It abandons the over-arching story of the previous titles and tells a completely unrelated tale. The player is able to choose Dee, Clare, or Quien as the playable character right from the beginning. Each one of them starts in a different location, but eventually will have to face the riddles of the Tower. The gameplay is similar to the previous Brandish games, with point-and-click interface (or keyboard short-cuts), real-time combat, and the ability to jump. As before, there is a RPG system with experience points and levels. The game abandons the top-down view of the previous games, using isometric perspective.</synopsis>

The king summons Shami, who, despite being a cute young girl, is the most powerful warrior of the kingdom. Shami has first to rescue the king's children, and eventually to find out the source of the demonic invasion.

Gameplay-wise, Branmarker mainly follows early  Dragon Quest template: it is a top-down RPG with random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective. The player controls Shami and another character who joins the party. Shami can cast a variety of offensive and healing spells, the majority of which must be found in treasure chests located in the dungeons rather than bought or learned. The main gameplay takes part in hostile areas, which are reasonably complex and maze-like, taking a while to explore. Leveling up is automatic, and combat mechanics are basic Japanese RPG fare. What makes it different are the various anime-style cutscenes scattered through the game, most of which feature nudity and erotic content. </synopsis>

      <title>Bunkasai</title>
      <synopsis>Bunkasai puts the player in the role of a male Japanese high-school student. One day his teacher tells him about the upcoming culture festival, giving him the assignment to help his lovely classmate Mia in the preparations. Naturally, the young man's mind is more directed towards... err... other aspects of Mia's personality. But what starts as a simple collaboration between high-school students soon turns into a drama full of violence and difficult decisions to make...

The game is a Japanese-style adventure with reduced command menu and interaction. At every given screen, there are a few commands (mostly just two), sometimes the standard Look and Talk, sometimes context-based actions. Usually the story advances automatically when the player has gone through all the commands several times.

The game has nudity and explicit sex scenes.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The hero of this game is an ordinary high school student (the player has to name him by himself). He is mostly interested in pretty girls, in particular the lovely Mika, with whom he is even ready to discuss books just to get her attention. One day, a beautiful woman appears in front of him out of nowhere. She says that she is Venus, the goddess of love. She comes from a world called Cal, the eternal world populated by lovely girls. She tells the hero that soon he will be needed in that world... and disappears. Was that a dream? Or will our hero really travel to the magical world of Cal and encounter dangers he hasn't even imagined before?

Cal is a visual novel, with the sole interaction consisting of choosing sentences to say and sometimes actions to do from a context-specific menu at the bottom of the screen. Usually only one such selection triggers the next event; some choices lead to Game Over. The game contains erotic pictures with nudity and sexual situations.</synopsis>

      <title>Can Can Bunny</title>
      <synopsis>The story of this game is simple. The protagonist is a lonely guy who constantly dreams about having a girlfriend but doesn't do anything to actually get one. One night, a fairy with bunny ears named Ariko appears in front of him and says she will fulfill one wish for him. Afterwards she simply guesses what the guy needs most badly: a girlfriend. So she gives him a magic book, which will give him information about five beautiful girls living somewhere in the city. With this book the hero's chances are increased. The quest for love begins!

The game plays like a standard Japanese adventure (still shots of locations, menu-based interface), with some additions. The hero can buy items and give them to girls as presents to impress them. The conversations with the girls involve going through several topics to find out what the girl likes. Once a girl seems to be "ready", it's possible to directly use commands such as "kiss the girl", "touch the girl" (with body parts specified), and even "***** the girl", which speaks for itself.</synopsis>

      <title>Can Can Bunny 5 12 Limited</title>
      <synopsis>The sixth (or fifth and a half, as the title suggests) installment of the long-running  Can Can Bunny series belongs to the same story arc that started in the  fourth game and was continued in the  fifth. The player character is the same nameless hero that starred in the two predecessors. But in this game, the lovely goddess Swatty is not here to help the hero to find girls. Instead, all the hero gets is an apprentice goddess named Sawady, who is just a brat and who bothers the hero all the time. Looks like this is going to be the toughest quest yet, with Sawady around and with pretty, but tough-to-seduce girls!

Gameplay-wise, Can Can Bunny 5 1/2 Limited is more simplified than the previous game. The standard menu commands ("Look", "Talk", etc.) are gone. The only possible interaction consists of moving to various locations (menu choice), and selecting a dialogue choice during conversations. There are also less girls than in the previous game, and no extras (such as the album with the pictures of the girls, etc.).</synopsis>

      <title>Can Can Bunny Spirits</title>
      <synopsis>The third in the  Can Can Bunny series, Can Can Bunny Spirits deals with a nameless hero (the player has to give him a name) who is - in accordance with Can Can Bunny tradition - a lonely guy who can't get a girlfriend. One night he sits at home and stares at the moon. Suddenly, the magic fairy Ariko appears in front of him and gives him... no, this time not the Magic Book, but a Magic Crescent! With the help of this crescent, the hero can turn into totally different young men - which will naturally increase his chances in impressing girls and ultimately having sex with them.

Can Can Bunny Spirits is much less of an adventure and more of a strategy game than its predecessors. Success depends even more on the preparations before the actual decisive stage. There is also extensive customization in this game. In the beginning, the hero chooses what he wants to be like, which includes age, height, blood type, and other parameters. Then Ariko introduces several girls to him, of which he has to choose one. Afterwards, it's a matter of asking the right questions and giving the right answers, combining knowledge of the girl's preferences and of the character's statistics. Each girl has a "love meter that can be raised or lowered depending on the player's strategies, and once it is full, the hero can have his way with the girl.</synopsis>

      <title>Cat's Part-1</title>
      <synopsis>Cat's Part 1 casts the player in the role of an unnamed protagonist, presumably young, male, and very interested in the members of the opposite sex. One fine day he meets Stella, the queen of magic world. She tells him that her duty is to sustain the balance between worlds, but now her power is fading, which means a new queen has to arrive and take her place. To find this queen, Stella tells her companion Pixie to open the gates to seven different worlds: three modern-day ones, three futuristic ones, and one "past", and sends the hero on the quest for balance in the world... and numerous sexually fulfilling encounters with pretty girls from different dimensions.

The game plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, with still pictures, plenty of text, and the necessity to go through all the commands several times to trigger new ones and eventually advance the story. However, unlike most games of this kind, Cat's Part 1 features a point-and-click interface along with the usual menu-based choices. Thus, the player can interact with various body parts of the girls, as well as some objects, by simply clicking on them.

The player must complete Modern World 1 first, but after that is free to travel to the six remaining worlds in any order. It is also possible to teleport out of the world at any time using a magic stone.</synopsis>

      <title>Chaos Angels</title>
      <synopsis>One day, a lone traveler came from the desert to a small camp. There, he sat down, weary from his long travel, enjoying a short rest. "Have you heard of the Tower of Ouroboros"? - asked him a bearded old man who was sitting nearby. - "A legend says that if fulfills all your wishes. Many heroes tried their luck there. None has returned. Dangers lure at every corner in the tower, deadly enchantresses who will bring demise on anyone daring to set his foot there". Without answering, the young traveler left the camp, and soon he was standing at the tower gate...

Chaos Angels is a semi-erotic RPG similar to the first two Dragon Knight games. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. You gradually explore the huge 3D dungeon, the Tower of Ouroboros, fighting enemies and gaining experience points. The combat engine differs from most other Japanese-style RPGs: for attacking, instead of choosing an appropriate command from a menu, you hit the enemy by moving towards it. You can also sometimes see the enemies approaching and turn to different sides during battle. Like in Dragon Knight games, the enemies are mostly sexy girls wearing revealing clothes or simply naked.</synopsis>

      <title>Charade</title>
      <synopsis>Charade describes the daily high-school routine of a girl named Kazumi. The game proceeds from one school day to another, putting Kazumi in the same situations, facing the same choices. Those choices, as well as random events and meetings with other characters, schoolmates and teachers (only female), change Kazumi's viewpoints as well as relationships with the other girls.

The game is basically a visual novel, though choices pop out more than usually in games of this genre. Basically, each situation leads to two or more choices, such as choosing a location to go to, waiting for a character or leaving the room, dialogue choices, joining high school clubs, etc.</synopsis>

      <title>Chick's Tale</title>
      <synopsis>Chicks' Tale is a card game with  hentai scenes. Player-controlled character competes against four young girls. The rules of the game are rather simple: each player is dealt ten cards. Following clockwise turns, each player has either to play a card that has a higher value than the previous one, or pass. Winning a hand allows the player to begin the next turn with the card of his/her choice. It is also possible to play several cards of the same value at once. Whoever has played all the ten cards first wins the round.

After three rounds, a cut-scene follows, during which the defeated character shares sexual experiences from her life, presented as sexually explicit images with text. Afterwards, the card game is resumed.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A young girl was enjoying a happy life with her boyfriend when suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful spell was cast and the poor boy was turned into stone. A sorceress named Christine appears and says that another sorceress called Jane was the culprit. The young heroine must find a way to defeat Jane and revert her boyfriend to normal.

Christine is a Japanese-style adventure taking place in a fantasy world. Screen-by-screen navigation is done with arrow keys. Every screen offers a few commands, mostly allowing to talk to the character present or sometimes perform other actions (such as have sex or attack). There is no inventory, but the player has to complete certain task and acquire specific items to be able to defeat Jane. It is also possible to attempt this at an earlier moment, but the result in that case is Game Over.

With the exception of her boyfriend, all the characters in the game are female. The game features scenes with explicit sexual situations as well as torture and violence.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The hero of this game (default name Ryouta) is a typical  hentai protagonist: a  male teenager who is interested only in sex. One day, Ryouta finds a cute black bunny and brings it home; the next morning, the bunny turns into a sexy black-haired girl! Needless to say the activities the two perform during the course of the game do not include playing chess or discussing philosophy. But Ryouta is not satisfied with the "bunny girl" alone, what with all those cute female schoolmates around him...

Coin is a visual novel with an emphasis on decision-making. Choices that the player has to make periodically lead to different scenes. Many of the choices (for example, raping a girl) are considered "wrong" and lead to a premature ending of the game.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Colonial Conquest is a grand strategy game set during the late 1800's and early 1900's that puts you in charge of one of the six Imperialistic powers of the time (Great Britain, France, Germany, U.S., Russia and Japan). Using diplomacy, espionage, armies and fleets, these six countries vie for control of more than 120 minor countries and each other. Your goal in the game is to conquer as many minor nations as possible and set yourself up as the mightiest ruler on Earth. There are three scenarios, and up to six people can play each as a separate nation - or the computer can take charge of all the other nations.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</synopsis>

Coming Heart is a standard low-interaction Japanese adventure, with the omni-present "Look-Talk-Think" commands, occasionally accompanied by "Move". On a few occasions there are some dialogue choices, which might lock/unlock certain scenes. The sex scenes are non-interactive.</synopsis>

      <title>Continental</title>
      <synopsis>A brave young warrior (whom the player names in the beginning of the game) has had his share of epic battles, so he decides to relax in him own house in the imperial capital city, dedicating himself to his other interests (read: women). However, one day a pretty young lady (whom the player also has to name) storms into his house, saying she has a message from the Emperor himself. A princess is missing, so our two heroes have to find her. And the hero also has to face some of his old foes...

Continental is a traditional Japanese RPG with a small party of heroes, top-down navigation, random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective, and no distinguishing characteristics but one: erotic scenes. There aren't as many here as in, for example,  Lightning Warrior Raidy games, and they mostly occur in city brothels or after boss battles. The enemies, however, do look like pretty (although demonic) girls. Instead of undressing, though (as they do in Raidy games), they just shrink in size upon defeat.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Youhei is a Japanese teenager who is bored with his life, unable to find excitement anywhere. Even sexual escapades with various women don't satisfy him: he craves for real adventures. But on that particular day, his wishes were fulfilled in a very unexpected way. He was talking to a schoolmate named Mahiro, a girl he didn't even like particularly, when something like an earthquake shattered the school. Youhei and Mahiro hurried to the nearby classroom, only to find a strange mirror-like object - which in fact was a portal to a dungeon in another world. Now the two teenagers have to find a way to escape from the dungeon - and eventually to return home.

Crystal Rinal is an adult dungeon crawler along the lines of  Words Worth or  Raidy games; but instead of a lonely hero/heroine, the player controls a party of two, Youhei and Mahiro, who fight randomly appearing monsters in turn-based combat. There is also a "talk" command that lets the two heroes chat with each other and comment on the situation. Some gameplay segments follow the template of a Japanese adventure, with menu-based commands and multiple choices during dialogues.</synopsis>

      <title>Custom Mate</title>
      <synopsis>A young man finds a mysterious box. Making sure no one is at home, he opens the box and finds a scroll with a magic incantation inside. He chants the magic spell - and immediately a cute female elf appears. She says she can create any girl the hero wants. But once the girl is created, he has to figure out how to win her good graces...

Custom Mate can be called a "seduction simulator". Lacking the adventure elements of  Cocktail's most famous series,  Can Can Bunny, Custom Mate offers much deeper simulation gameplay instead. In the beginning of the game, the player effectively "creates" the girl he will need to seduce; it is possible to choose age, height, breast size, hair style, and personality. Mixing all these parameters results in different girls who require different approach. For example, an older, experienced and direct woman might appreciate physical stimulation (kissing etc.), while a young shy girl needs to talk more before the hero can afford any straight-forward actions. 

The gameplay is menu-driven - the player can choose to talk, to ask, to look, to touch, to kiss, and to take off the girl's clothes. Choosing one of these actions usually leads to a sub-menu, which varies depending on the girl and the current situation. For example, the "talk" menu usually brings a large sub-menu of more precise actions ("praise", "order", "beg", etc.), each of which opens new sub-menus. Similarly, physical interaction can also become quite detailed: the "kiss" command opens a sub-menu ("lick", "bite", etc.). Physical interaction is made more precise by implementing a point-and-click interface; in many cases, choosing the exact body part to interact with can be a matter of "life and death", since it is possible to make a girl very angry, which might lead to a Game Over.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The second game in the  Custom Mate series once again allows the hero to create the girl of his dreams; this time not magically, but by engaging the services of Custom Corporation, whose operator is nevertheless still the same cute elf who created the girls in the previous game.

The "girl creation" part offers more possibilities than before, such as exact bra size or the clothes the girl will wear (school girl, nurse, etc.). This allows more combinations and therefore more different girls. The "seduction simulator" part is simplified compared to the first game. Instead of menu-based interface, initiating conversations, and physical interaction, the entire seduction part is composed of a conversation between the protagonist and the girl. The dialogue/action choices, however, are numerous and varied. The difficulty level varies greatly depending on the girl's personality, age, profession, etc.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>It's Christmas. Hayashi Ryuusuke is walking through the crowded city, feeling sad that he is alone on such a day. Suddenly, he spots a neon sign: Custom Mate. He enters and sees a strange receptionist with elf-like ears and a magic symbol on the forehead. She creates the girl of his dreams and they get married! But this is just the beginning, and Ryuusuke realizes that marriage is not all about the honeymoon...

The third  Custom Mate game differs from its predecessors by offering much deeper simulation gameplay, which includes different aspects of the life of a married couple beside just sex. In the beginning, the player creates the protagonist, choosing his age, blood type, and personality. The future wife is created the same way. Unlike the previous games, it is impossible to change appearance and physical aspects of the girl; however, there are many more personality traits.

After the honeymoon, the couple returns to daily routine. The player can make daily or monthly schedule. The wife's behavior is determined by character creation, but also by the choices the player makes. The wife would often ask questions, make suggestions, etc.; the player's reaction determines future interactions and the overall development of the relationship. The couple has various parameters, from love level to monetary wealth. Sex interaction plays an important role; the player should choose the right actions, depending on the wife's personality, otherwise the relationship will deteriorate. Menu-based interface is utilized for most of the game, but the actual sex interaction is done in point-and-click fashion, with action icons.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Around the turn of the millennium, global warming has become a reality. Abusing energy and the Earth's resources, humanity has driven itself to a point where normal life on Earth could no longer exist. Drastic rise of temperatures caused planet-wide dehydration. The only way to keep existing was through the Cyber Net, a virtual reality system. But soon the Cyber Net began to suffer from continuous assaults by hackers, who programmed lethal viruses into it. Thus, the Cyber Police was born. The protagonist of the game is a high-ranked officer of Cyber Police. With the help of his team, he has to solve the hacker problem once and for all.

Cyber Illusion is a Japanese-style adventure. The interaction with the game world is performed by choosing the menu commands Look, Talk, Move, as well as context-specific ones that appear during some scenes. It is also possible to influence the course of the story by making choices at certain points. 

The game has explicit sex scenes, which are interactive and feature a point-and-click interface.</synopsis>

      <title>Cybernetic Hi-School Part 3 Gunbuster</title>
      <synopsis>Just like the two previous Cybernetic Hi-School games, the third part is a strip quiz game. This time, it is centred upon Gainax's famous Gunbuster animation videos. 

You, as an alpha-class Top, are supposed to win three keys to pilot the Great Gunbuster robot against the cosmic threat to humanity. The keys are held by Jung-Freud, Kazumi (oneesama) and Noriko, and you must retrieve the keys by defeating each character in a quiz game, which has the side-effect of stripping them of all their clothes. 

Each character asks questions around a certain theme; Jung-Freud asks about the Soviet Union and military technology, Kazumi asks about fashion and Noriko asks about cult science fiction and animation.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A young man gets involved in a struggle between the gods Martis and Mira. Serving Martis, he believes that in order to restore the balance he has to unseal this deity, the protector of all women. Fourteen chosen girls must fight alongside the hero, venturing into the depth of a sacred mountain and helping him to defeat countless monsters who live there.

Made by the creators of Rance series, Dalk is an erotic RPG. However, it is more heavy on strategy element than Rance games. Town navigation is done from first-person view. You choose your party members among the 14 available girls, and take them to fight in the mountain. Once you enter the dungeon, the game switches to top-down view, and you advance in turn-based mode, assigning commands to your party and waiting for the enemy party to move. You can attack when an enemy is in range, or cast spells with your magic users.</synopsis>

      <title>Dark Gaiden</title>
      <synopsis>Although it is branded a gaiden ("side story"), this game is actually a direct sequel to the  first D'ark. The anti-hero of the previous game, the mysterious Dulldeek, has released the four Dragon Knights in order to help the Darkness to defeat the Light in the upcoming battle. After the light warrior Felnous was defeated by Dulldeek, it looked like the Light has lost...

D'ark Gaiden allows the player to play through two scenarios, one continuing the adventures of Dulldeek and the Dragon Knights (starting as the Black Dragon Knight Zarsch, one of Dulldeek's companions), the other casting Felnous as a protagonist, recovering after the battle with Dulldeek and swearing to exact revenge.

The gameplay is essentially the same as in the previous game: basic solo dungeon crawl through pseudo-3D mazes, turn-based combat against random enemies. It is now possible to cast defensive support magic. The animations in combat are improved, and there are more different textures in the dungeons. As in the first game, there is the possibility to turn random encounters off; in this game, there is an additional "MAX" option, which cranks the encounter rate up.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In 1999, the Third World War has devastated most of the countries on the Earth. The one that emerged stronger than before was Japan. It became the world's undisputed leader in technology. In the beginning of the 21st century, a company named Nexus began developing a new technology that would eventually lead to production of cyborgs. Nexus soon became the world's most powerful corporation. By then, cyborgs broke loose and caused violent incidents everywhere. A special unit called "Hunter" was deployed to combat them. But Nexus wouldn't stop with their experiments. In 2014, their newest project began, called "Halleluja"...

In Deep, the player can choose between four main characters, which include the result of the Halleluja project, an artificial young girl who is called "Jesus" and proclaimed to be the savior of the world, as well as three other, less important characters, all having their own agenda. The story is, however, the same for all characters.

The gameplay consists of moving on a map with grids and accessing different locations. Sometimes there would be branching paths, but the progression is mostly linear and the same for all characters. Most of the locations contain one screen with a character picture. It is possible to interact with characters in point-and-click fashion, with the cursor turning to "Look", "Talk", and other commands. 

Sometimes, enemies would pop out and attack the player character. Some battles are pre-set and story-related. Even though the player characters have statistics and carry weapons, there are no real RPG elements in the game. The turn-based battles have a timer; if the player failed to choose an action within the time limit, the enemy will have a free turn. To make combat more challenging, the command menu is very large and has useful as well as useless commands, which are mixed up at the beginning of each turn.

The game contains graphics with explicit sexual content.</synopsis>

      <title>Demon City</title>
      <synopsis>On the continent of Barnhedge, there lies a kingdom named Vagrand. The inhabitants of the country are followers of what they call the "True Religion", which teaches them, quite simply, to enjoy life in all possible ways, without controlling their desires and lust. As a result, the capital of Vagrand became the center of corporeal pleasures, and its neighbors started calling it the "Demon City". The player controls a Vagrand knight who is sent by the princess Leticia on a confident mission. But intrigues and uncontrolled lust surround the hero everywhere: opposition in the palace, a young girl named Milk who wants him all for herself, and the mysterious cult of the Moon are all there to make the hero's life hard...

Demon City is a Japanese-style adventure. The interface consists of icons, selectable at any time, which correspond to actions such as Examine, Talk, Move, etc. The player can visit various locations in the city and its surrounding (done by choosing the Move command and a location name from the menu). During sex scenes, the interface changes somewhat, with additional icons for more specific sexual actions.</synopsis>

      <title>Dengeki Division</title>
      <synopsis>The powerful god known as Black B was securely sealed, preventing his powers from corrupting humans. The people of the Kingdom enjoyed a prosperous, peaceful life. But that ended when the nearby country, ruled by a ruthless Empress, heard of the sealed god. The Empire attacked the Kingdom, which had no other choice but release Black B and use his powers to defend themselves. Black B readily agreed to help, on one condition: all the generals in his army must be female...

Dengeki Division is a turn-based strategy/RPG hybrid. The player's first input is to throw dice to determine the amount of points that can be used to raised the parameters (strength, intelligence, agility, etc.) of the female generals. The player also assigns character classes (warrior, monk, magician, etc.) to them. Afterwards, the story unrolls; battles are dictated by the story, and there is no movement in the game outside of the battle field. Combat takes place on isometric locations, where only the immediate surroundings of the player-controlled characters are shown. The player then navigates the characters over the field, attacking enemies when they are in range of physical attacks or magic spells. Hurting a female enemy character (or sustaining damage) triggers a small nude picture of said character.</synopsis>

      <title>Dengeki Nurse</title>
      <synopsis>The main hero of the game is a young doctor named Tanchi. One day, his boss, the old professor Akihabara, invites him to his office and reveals some secrets concerning the young man's parents and an international crime syndicate known as Black Cross, which Akihabara was trying to bring down. Meanwhile, Black Cross sends a female agent under codename 0074 to assassinate a certain powerful man who happens to stay in the same hospital where Tanchi works...

Dengeki Nurse consists of two main gameplay modes: Japanese-style adventure and turn-based one-on-one battles. The adventure gameplay stars Tanchi as protagonist, and requires the player to click on verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, Action, and Move) to advance the story. The turn-based battles have agent 0074 (Kirara) as the playable character, and occur as events dictated by the story; there is also a "Free Battle" mode (accessible from the main menu), which allows the player to fight against an opponent of his/her choice. Kirara can perform regular attacks (punches and kicks) for low damage, spend turns to charge power and unleash a devastating attack afterwards, or use various drugs for healing and supporting purposes.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>This edition of DOR is a collection of three short stories, taken from two different  DOR games:

From the  first DOR:
Kanako's Depression: You are visited by a beautiful vampire who wants only one thing: To suck your blood. In return, she will be your servant for one day.

The Telephone Scandal: You call into a telephone dating service. You can choose to talk to a young schoolgirl or an older working woman.
From  DOR 2:
Armored Fighter Gyleban: Parody of good-versus-evil anime, such as Macross. 
Each story can be finished in approximately ten minutes. DOR features depictions of sex, and is for adults only.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The sequel to  DOR is structured exactly the same way as the first game: play any of the three unrelated scenarios, accessible directly from the main menu.

The first scenario takes the player into France of 16th century, during a witch hunt. The playable character is a young girl who is falsely accused of being a witch and is taken into a dungeon, interrogated, and tortured. 

The second scenario follows the adventures of a young boy who has lost his way in a forest. Suddenly he meets a cute little female elf, who is willing to help him find the right way, in exchange for some other favors...

The third scenario is named "Armored Fighter Gyleban" and is in a way a parody on sci-fi anime movies. The player controls a commander of a unit of female fighters with enhanced abilities, that must stop an evil organization from conquering our world.

Like in the first  DOR, the gameplay is limited to selecting actions/answers from a menu at each screen. Correctly chosen actions will advance the story, while wrong ones will lead to a premature ending.</synopsis>

    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Dor Special Edition 93</title>
      <synopsis>DOR Special Edition '93 is neither a compilation, re-release, nor a remake; it is an independent entry in the  DOR series. Typically for the series, the game consists of three completely unrelated scenarios. They can be accessed from the initial game "hub", which is viewed from a top-down perspective and allows the player to control the sexy demon Akuma, the series' mascot, as she runs around a small town, visiting houses that lead to the game's features: playing the scenarios, viewing the pictures, getting acquainted with the developers, etc.

The first scenario tells the story of a Japanese businessman and treasure hunter named Hiroshi, who has organized a perilous expedition into South American jungle, hoping to find the legendary spring of eternal youth. However, on the way to their discovery, the group has to confront monsters and other dangerous specimens of the jungle...

The second scenario is set in a pseudo Middle-Eastern environment, and focuses on a man named Farouk, who was cursed by an evil magician. In order to remove the curse, Farouk travels through a vast desert to a nearby town, hoping to find people who would help him in his predicament.

The third scenario directly continues one of the scenarios of  DOR 2. It is sub-titled Armored Fighter Gyleban, and is the second part of the story. The protagonist is the leader of a squad of female fighters, who confront an organization under the leadership of the evil Grauber. Grauber's warrior, a young girl named Meiya, switches sides and decides to help the heroes in their battle.

The gameplay is mostly similar to other DOR games - picking choices from a menu until the next scene is triggered. However, during certain scenes the interface switches to point-and-click, with selectable icons ("tongue" and "hand"), which pretty much explains the direction those "certain scenes" lead into.</synopsis>

      <title>Dor Special Edition Sakigake</title>
      <synopsis>DOR Special Edition: Sakigake is the fourth entry in the  DOR series. Unlike all the previous games, it contains only one scenario instead of the usual three.

The scenario follows the story of Kensuke Funaki, a young boy who attends a prestigious private high school, where the students specialize in sports as well as various theatrical activities. The biggest event of the school is an all-female wrestling competition. Kensuke finds himself in a promising situation: in order to secure his support, the young and pretty competitors are willing to go far - very, very far...

The gameplay in DOR Special Edition: Sakigake is  the same as in the previous entries. At every screen, the player reads a bulk of text (descriptions and dialogue), after which a menu with a few (usually three) selectable actions/responses pops out. It is often needed to go through the choices several times before the next event is triggered, and the player is taken to another screen.</synopsis>

      <title>Dragon Eyes</title>
      <synopsis>Dragon Eyes is a "space opera" kind of story, focusing on a young girl named Ines, who lives on the planet Miu of the Phi Sun. She grew up together with a space agent named Klind, to whom she refers as "brother". One day, her superior from the planet Garudoria informs her that Klind has disappeared during one of his missions and might be in danger. Ines travels to Garudoria to find additional information, and soon becomes involved in a vast space conflict...

Dragon Eyes plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, with commands such as Examine, Talk, Think, and Move appearing on every screen. Choosing one of those commands usually leads into a sub-menu of objects. There is also limited usage of items, which is sometimes required in order to advance in the game.

There are a few scenes with graphical nudity, but no explicit sex scenes.</synopsis>

  <game name="Dragon Half">

    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Dragon Half</title>
      <synopsis>One of the games based on Ryuusuke Mita's eponymous manga. The story focuses on the manga's protagonist, a cute half-human, half-dragon girl named Mink. She is in love with a pop singer and dragon-slayer Dick Saucer; however, to win his love, Mink has to find a magical potion to turn her into a human. In the game, Mink and her friend Lufa and Pia are having a vacation on the beach, listening to Dick Saucer's concert on the radio. When Dick mentions Mink in his "special thanks" speech, she decides to find him no matter what, even if it means changing her own nature.

This version of Dragon Half is an RPG with card-based system. The player navigates Mink, Lufa, and Pia through the top-down environments, encountering random enemies. During battles, the player selects cards for attack, healing, and other actions; there is no individual control of party members, and they also share an HP pool. The player can select several cards of the same type to increase the corresponding effect, or choose to save some of the cards for later to perform even more powerful combos.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Strawberry Fields was once a peaceful land. Ruled by the lovely queen Luna and populated only by women, the country knew no trouble. The Goddess Tower protected the inhabitants of Strawberry Fields. But recently, something happened in the tower. It is said that a dragon descended upon it, spawning an army of dragon knights who were threatening the peaceful land. The queen Luna summons you, a wandering adventurer, to descend into the depth of the Goddess Tower and to purge the evil from the land.

Dragon Knight marked the beginning of Elf's erotic RPG series. The game is played entirely from a first-person perspective. In the town, you move around by selecting destinations from a menu. Once you enter the tower, you navigate your character through 3D mazes, fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. Enemies in the game are scantily clad, attractive young women; there are also several scenes with explicit nudity.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Dragon Knight 4 is a sequel to Knights of Xentar. Years have passed after Takeru (a.k.a. Desmond, the hero of the previous Dragon Knight games) defeated the ultimate evil. He married his sweetheart Luna, and they had a son named Kakeru. This fifteen-year-old boy has one weakness: he likes naked female elves. But soon he learns that the evil wizard Lushifon wants to turn all people into stones and control the whole world while nobody is able to stop him. Together with the mysterious swordsman Eto and many other heroes, Kakeru must perform his ultimate quest and defeat Lushifon and his minions.

In this tactical role-playing game the player controls nine units in battles, assigned according to the class of the character who leads the unit. The opponents also form similar groups, and are also divided into classes. Each class has its own range, strengths, and weaknesses. There are many characters the players can recruit to the party, and they belong to different classes (barbarians, archers, magicians, etc.).

The adult content (scenes which include nudity) has been removed from the console releases. The PlayStation version has updated graphics and CG animations.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>This version of Dragon Knight III is based on the earlier computer release, known in the West as Knights of Xentar. While retaining the story, the graphical style, and the basic location layout of the computer version, this release has substantial gameplay differences.

Unlike in the computer version, the battles are not real-time, but turn-based, and utilize a different perspective; randomly encountered enemies are fought in a first-person, Dragon Quest-like traditional Japanese RPG style. Enemy design is also quite different; many of the monsters from the original version have been replaced with female characters. The graphics in the top-down areas have been slightly enhanced.

This version also censors the adult content. The scenes are still suggestive, but there is no explicit nudity in them any more. Some of the cutscenes have been completely re-drawn, eliminating even implicit sexual activity.</synopsis>

      <title>Dragon Master Silk II</title>
      <synopsis>In this sequel to  Dragon Master Silk: Ryuu Shoukan Musume, the young Silk and her minions, the three cute, sexy elemental dragon girls Ao, Aka, and Ki are joined by a new dragon girl - Ruli, the purple-haired Dragon of Wisdom. The team shows the new recruit the cave with the sealed evil dragon - but an unfortunate accident breaks the seal, monsters invade the land, and our heroines have to save it once again, venturing into deep and dangerous dungeons...

Dragon Master Silk II plays very similarly to the previous game, one notable exception being the extra party member (Ruli). Most of the game takes place in first-person maze-like dungeons. Enemies appear randomly. It is possible to set the party on auto, assign general strategies ("don't use magic", etc.), or control every party member individually. The party can visit the town to buy items and rest. 

Typically for the series, Dragon Master Silk II features "super-deformed" graphics, humorous dialogues and situations. There are plenty of scantily dressed young girls and sexual innuendo in the game, but no explicit nudity or sex scenes.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Commonly considered the first Japanese-made game with role-playing elements, Dragon and Princess involves a quest of a party of adventurers who is requested by the king to exterminate bandits and eventually rescue the princess from the clutches of a dragon. Gameplay-wise, the game is for the most part closer to the adventure format than to true role-playing. Much of the game consists of text and plays like interactive fiction, with text-based commands and movement through maze-like environments achieved by typing letters corresponding to the four directions (N, S, W and E). The RPG element is manifested in tactical top-down battles, during which the player navigates characters in a turn-based fashion. It is possible to take cover and protect weaker allies. Dead characters cannot be resurrected afterwards.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The lovely princess was abducted by a mysterious giant black bird. The bird carried the prisoner to a tower on the lake shore. Who would be brave enough to venture into the tower and to rescue the princess? Only the courageous knight Landis, aided by the Goddess herself!

Dragoon Armor for Adult is a very basic first-person dungeon crawler, with vector graphics (like in early  Wizardry games), but without party members; Landis explores the similarly-looking mazes (no auto-map feature) all by himself, fighting randomly appearing enemies in simple turn-based combat. It is possible to buy weapons, armor, and items outside, but there are no other locations to access beside the tower. Event cut-scenes may feature nudity, but no "hardcore" sexual situations.</synopsis>

      <title>E.S.P.</title>
      <synopsis>E.S.P. is a side-scrolling shooter. There is no plot in the game - the player controls a robot-like flying device, shooting his way through hordes of organic and mechanical enemies. The player-controlled device can be moved in four directions, and also adjust the angle of fire. There is only one kind of power-up in the game (a floating letter P); eating it will expand the range of the device's fire and also grant it an additional weapon (shooting blue spheres); the player can then adjust the fire angle in such a way that the device can shoot in different directions with different weapons.

Each stage features two or three mini-bosses and a final boss. Fighting the bosses usually requires memorizing their fire patterns, avoiding their attacks and firing when there is an opening. There is no health bar in the game; the player is sent back to the beginning of the stage whenever his device touches an enemy or is hit by enemy fire. There are unlimited continues.

Instead of cut-scenes, usually advancing the plot in this type of games, the player is shown a completely unrelated erotic picture of a young girl after the end of each level.</synopsis>

      <title>Early Kingdom</title>
      <synopsis>A group of adventurers, led by the young mercenary named Guy, arrives at the Port City, looking for job. The situation in the city is not a very peaceful one: corrupted officials, thugs roaming the streets, nobility who won't listen to the pleas of simple people. Guy and his two initial companions, Quinn and Goran, must first find more people to join their party. But as  more adventurers join, the city is overrun by monsters, and Guy realizes it's not about finding job any more - it's about protecting the entire country.

Even though it was made by a Japanese company, Early Kingdom is more similar to Western RPGs, being more exploration-oriented rather than focusing on characters and their personal stories. Graphically, it discards the traditional Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in favor of realistic character portraits. The entire game is played from top-down perspective. Combat is real-time, utilizing the characteristic  Kure Software engine with large parties of both playable characters and enemies, allowing massive battle scenes. The player can control only one character at a time, while the others fight on their own. Attacks are executed simply by bumping into enemies. The characters get experience points and level up from defeating monsters. There is no world map in the game, but a continuous world of wilderness areas and towns.</synopsis>

      <title>Edge</title>
      <synopsis>In Edge the player controls a cube in a geometric landscape consisting of platforms and moving shapes viewed from an isometric perspective. Throughout the world are prisms that the player has to pick up, although they are optional to finish a level. Each level is full of traps where the player can fall if he does not manage to roll his cube from a platform to another in the right time. After a level has been completed the player gets a rating based on how many times he has failed, the number of prisms he has picked up and how long it has taken. 

One of the most important game elements is the ability to balance on the edges of cubes in the game world. By maintaining an equilibrium, it is possible to climb on top of platforms and hang on to moving objects to cross gaps. The balance is maintained by gently adjusting the cube's position. Advanced levels require a quick succession of different skills and abilities. Players are also able to transform the cube into a smaller version to traverse narrow passages.</synopsis>

      <title>Elm Knight</title>
      <synopsis>Elm Knight is set in a futuristic world, dominated by the totalitarian regime of the Empire, which hunts down the so-called "Irregulars" - people who have supernatural abilities. The young Rick Chandler is attending the Pilot Academy, where he learns to control giant robots known as "MPS". He discovers that he might be in possession of magical abilities (which would make him an Irregular), and escapes to the desert, where he meets a girl named Selena, who directs him to the base of a rebel organization. Joining the rebels, Rick must face his Imperial superiors, some of which are closely related to him...

Elm Knight is an action game that mostly focuses on giant robot ("mech") combat. The game is set in pseudo-3D maze-like environments (with an auto-map) and is viewed from first-person perspective. Enemies (such as enemy robots) walk around in hostile areas. The playable robot, controlled by Rick, is equipped with projectile weapons of different kinds, with limited ammo. It is also possible to use melee attacks to defeat the opponents. In some areas, Rick is controlled directly (though the view and the interface are the same), and is able to use weapons such as a handgun to defend himself.</synopsis>

      <title>Emerald Dragon</title>
      <synopsis>In Emerald Dragon the player takes control of Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...

The game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a "world map": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>You are a dim ignorant Apprentice Enchanter, but your task is enormous.  You must save the world from the warlock Krill who is ruling the land with his evil powers. You are not the first in this quest but hopefully you will be the first to succeed, as the more experienced members of the Circle of Enchanters are powerless. You know  the basics of magic and will have the chance to learn many spells. Keep your wits and use everything you can to your benefit!

Enchanter is a text adventure set in the Zork universe, following the original Zork trilogy. As in the previous games, the player interacts with the environment by typing in text commands, usually combinations of verbs and objects. A new feature in the game is the player character's ability to cast spells. These spells must be memorized before the protagonist is able to cast them, and are learned during the course of the game. The text parser understands the names of the spells as verbs, and the player only needs to type in the spell name and the name of an object he/she wishes to cast that particular spell on.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>This is a collection of three mini-games loosely adapting the May, 1983 Choose Your Own Adventure gamebook number 8 of the same name. In that book, the reader plays a secret agent underground in the nation of Dorado, a fractured rump state of the former US southwest in the year 2035. The book concerns itself with escaping from this totalitarian state and returning to democratic Turtalia; the game covers similar territory with less hyperfiction and more primitive driving and flight simulators, following traversal of a 3D maze representing town streets accessed after a jailbreak. With the player are three fellow travelers: Matt, resistance leader Zoey, and codebreaker Fred -- one of whom is a traitor.</synopsis>

      <title>EVE Burst Error</title>
      <synopsis>Eve burst error is set in modern-day Japan. The player controls two characters: a young, seemingly careless private investigator Kojiroh, and the special agent Marina. Kojiroh has been struggling to make a living as a lone PI, but now luck seems to smile to him: the director of the Eldian International School, Mr. Ko, asks him to find a missing painting, supposedly of great value. At the same time, Marina is hired by the ambassador of the fictional Middle East republic Eldia to protect his daughter Mayako from terrorists. Switching between Kojiroh and Marina, the player gradually finds out the connection between the two cases and plunges deeper into a mystery that involves political struggle, scientific discoveries, and horrifying murders.

The game is a traditional Japanese adventure: the player interacts with the world by choosing appropriate commands from the menu (which is different for every location). There are no puzzles to solve, and the player makes progress in the game by examining the environments and talking to the characters. At certain points, it is necessary to switch between the two characters and make them cooperate.

The original version was a full-fledged  hentai game with explicit sex scenes. Subsequent releases removed those, but still contained a lot of sexual innuendo in the dialogues and images of half-naked girls.</synopsis>

      <title>Farland Story 2</title>
      <synopsis>Farland Story 2 is an independent side-story to the Farland Story series (this game shouldn't be confused with  Farland Story Denki: Arc Ou no Ensei, which is also known as "Farland Story 2"). The game is set in the same time line as the second and the third "mainstream" Farland Story games, 20 years after Arc has become a king. Peace has returned to the world, but on the continent of Ionia, an emperor is plotting an evil scheme. His son Riad refuses to accept the methods of his father, especially when he wants to use Serena, a girl he loves, for his plans of war and conquest. During a quarrel, Riad attacks the emperor's minister, and is forced to flee the castle together with Serena. The adventure of the runaway prince begins...

Graphically and gameplay-wise, the game is similar to other Farland Story games, although its setting is generally more dark. The game consists of large strategic battles, during which you move your party over the battle location, attacking enemies physically when they are in range of your weapons, and casting healing and offensive magic. Like in other Farland Story games, the death of the main character (Riad in this case) means instant Game Over.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In File, the player takes the role of young man named Pat, who is working for a powerful state security organization in an unspecified English-speaking country. His boss, a mysterious high-ranked agent named Cropp, tells him about a strictly classified project under the codename IBIS, which was intended as a counter-terror measure. Four young women have been apprehended under suspicious circumstances (amnesia following an accident, proximity to weapon research facility, etc.). Pat's task is to interrogate those women and to find out the truth about their activities.

In the beginning of the game the protagonist is shown all the four dossiers, and the player can choose to play the four interrogations in any order. The game has a typical Japanese-adventure interface with verb commands ("Look", "Talk", "Think") and some specific commands during particular situations. The game advances through continuous usage of these commands. 

The interrogation of the girls always leads to sexual situations - consensual or not. The game has scenes with explicit sexual content.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Long time ago, seven gods who were guarding the Earth defeated the evil god Gadim. But time has passed, and the seven benevolent gods have vanished one by one. Evil has awaken from its slumber. It's time for somebody else - a human - to become a hero and to defeat it once and for all. This chosen one is a young girl named Thiria Fray. She must find other girls with supernatural powers to aid her on her quest to defeat the evil.

Filsnown plays like a standard top-down Japanese RPG: the party of heroines roams the world map, descend into dungeons, fight random enemies in first-person perspective combat using regular attacks or magic, and visit towns and villages to buy supplies and to rest. It contains cut-scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations. </synopsis>

      <synopsis>Klaus is a young man who has seen Jessica, the love of his life, killed in front of his eyes. Blaming himself for not being able to stop it, Klaus joins a group of mercenaries. Traveling together with his friends Bayse and Miria, Klaus encounters Stella, the princess of Valnausha. After the princess gets kidnapped, Klaus swears that he'll do everything he can to bring her back...

Foreigner is a RPG with a navigation system and interaction reminiscent of Japanese adventures. Menu-based commands ("Look", "Talk", etc.) are present at every screen, and the game lacks physical movement: even in hostile areas (dungeons), the player moves around by selecting screens on a mini-map, which takes him to the next picture. The RPG angle is traditional Japanese style, minus the physical navigation; when Klaus and his party are attacked, a combat screen with battle commands ("Attack, "Magic", etc.) appears. It is possible to buy items and weapons, and the heroes gain experience points and level up in a standard RPG fashion.

There is sexual innuendo and mild nudity in the game, but no explicit sex.</synopsis>

  <game name="Foxy">

    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Foxy</title>
      <synopsis>The story of Foxy is rather basic: a hostile army from a country known simply as "Red" attacks the capital city of the "Blue" nation. Not only the enemy tries to invade the most important strategic points of the city - enemy generals also try to capture and enslave the "Blue" girls! Naturally, they must be stopped! As the commander of the Blue army, it's the player's task to face enemy forces in battles, rescue the girls, and drive the Reds out of the city.

Foxy is a pure strategy game, without any RPG elements. The player is taken from one battle to another; there is no gameplay outside of battles. The battles take place in various city districts. The player navigates his/her units in turn-based fashion. In the beginning, the battles are relatively small-scale, with infantry and tank units; as the game progresses, more unit types are introduced, including massive rocket-launching tanks, jet planes, catapults, etc.

Each unit has distinct advantages and disadvantages, different mobility, attack range, etc. For example, infantry units that carry rocket launchers can only attack diagonally, but cannot be hurt when they attack tanks from that position; being attacked frontally, however, makes them very vulnerable. Terrain also plays a role; certain terrain types may slow down certain unit types, or be completely impassable to others. Each next battle features more complex layouts and larger amounts of units.

Between the battles there are cut-scenes, most of which are dedicated to rescuing the girls, and feature nudity and mild sexual situations.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Fushigi no Umi no Nadia is one of the several games based on the anime series The Secret of Blue Water. The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. The player controls Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle.</synopsis>

      <title>Gaias Lord</title>
      <synopsis>The hero of this game, named Zenith, has borrowed too much money. The village inhabitants just beat him up, but the village elder has other plans. It appears that several young girls have been missing lately. As a punishment, Zenith must venture to the nearby tower, infested by all kinds of monsters and demons, and see if he could find the girls there.

Gaias Lord is an action game with a lot of environmental puzzles, most of which involves pushing crates to clear the way through the top-down dungeon, accessing treasure chests, keys, and other important items. There are also enemies wandering around the tower, whom Zenith can fight in real-time combat, using his sword or special techniques. There are slight RPG elements, as Zenith can equip various weapons and armors scattered through the dungeon.

The game has anime-style cut scenes, some of which feature nudity and sexual situations.</synopsis>

      <title>Gakuen Bomber</title>
      <synopsis>Gakuen Bomber begins with a dream; more precisely, the dream the protagonist of the game, an ordinary Japanese high-school boy, is having: that of his sister having passionate sex with... a female classmate. Since afterwards he begins to dream about spaceships and aliens, he assumes that dream had nothing to do with reality... or has it? Exploring the high school he attends, the hero makes some startling and not very unpleasant discoveries...

Gakuen Bomber is set almost entirely in the high-school, and mostly consists of the protagonist wandering around and triggering event scenes (often of sexual nature) that advance the story. However, the player is given considerable freedom to explore the rather large school compounds, interacting with many on-screen objects in point-and-click fashion. </synopsis>

      <title>Gakuen Senshi Sailor Fighter</title>
      <synopsis>Minako was just an ordinary Japanese teenage girl - until she was killed by an evil gym teacher, whom she dared to oppose. However, she was resurrected with the help of cyborg technology, operated by a mysterious creature with a normal Japanese surname Yoda - and yes, he looks just like the famous character from  Star Wars. Yoda explains to Minako that her school has been possessed by demons, one of which is her former gym teacher, now turned principal! Minako heads back to her school, determined to demonstrate her new skills to the forces of evil!

Looks like all those cybernetic enhancements served just one purpose: enrich Minako's knowledge of contemporary Japanese pop culture. Because the only gameplay in this game involves answering timed trivia questions. The moment Minako encounters an opponent, the screen displays a fake battle field, and the quiz begins. If the player answers correctly, Minako causes damage to her opponent; if the answer is wrong, Minako sustains damage herself. Too many wrong answers result in Minako's death, this time irrevocable.

Extensive cut-scenes occupy the space between those "quiz battles". Most of them are heavy on explicit sexual content.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Galaga is a vertical arcade shooter from Namco.  You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen, scrolling left and right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders--and to fire your own missiles to fight back!

There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a "challenge stage" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.

A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final "hit ratio"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</synopsis>

Some of the scenarios also allow the player to engage in a war between multiple countries (up to 5). Included in the game is a scenario editor, which allows the player to create his own maps from scratch.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Jackie was having an ordinary life which seemed to culminate with an intimate intercourse with his sweetheart Mika. However, shortly afterwards he met a mysterious old woman who prophesied his imminent death. He was then transferred to the magical Realm Above the Clouds populated by humans and demons alike. Jackie has to find a way to return to our world and save Mika, who is considered a powerful goddess of love among the indigenous people.

Giga Mortion is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game viewed from an isometric perspective. Enemies appear randomly and the battles are turn-based. The player controls Jackie and two female characters who eventually join the party and can use magic spells as well as physical attacks. Leveling up is done in the automatic fashion characteristic of the genre. The game features adult cutscenes, some of which are animated.</synopsis>

    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Goice</title>
      <synopsis>Goice contains three episodes, which tell three separate stories, but share the same villains: human-looking aliens under the command of the insane female captain Storm, and an army of mechanical dolls they use to kidnap and rape young girls from the Earth. 

The first episode focuses on two girls, Harue and Kyoko, who survive a car crash caused by the appearance of a giant foll that attacks the city in a Godzilla fashion, only to be captured by an army of smaller once, brought to Strom's space ship, and raped in various ways.

The second episode focuses on three very young high school girls, who hear a mysterious voice on the street and run to seek help by a classmate, but are sexually assaulted by the horny alien dolls.

The heroes of the third episode are two young martial artists, the boy Kenji and the girl Kaede; Kaede is kidnapped and raped by Strom and her hermaphrodite subordinate, and Kenji is trying to recue her.

Goice is almost entirely pornographic; by far the largest bulk of the game is dedicated to explicit sex scenes accompanied by long passages of text. Most of the sex scenes feature short loop-like animation. The stories are entirely linear, but some scenes offer interactivity in form of a point-and-click interface, with the cursor automatically turning into the only available action on the only available spot. This interaction is used only to deplete the available actions and advance the plot.</synopsis>

      <title>Gokko Vol. 01 Doctor</title>
      <synopsis>The story of Gokko Vol. 01: Doctor is quite simple: the protagonist is a young man who dreams of becoming a great doctor, study abroad, and win the Nobel prize. In reality, however, he is just an ordinary aspiring physician who has to practice his medical skills in a Japanese hospital. However, seeing how all the doctors, nurses, and patients turn out to be gorgeous young women, the hero quickly forgets the Hippocratic oath in favor of his less altruist, but more basic instincts...

The gameplay offers very little interaction and mostly involves choosing between a few dialogues lines and actions (always context-specific, without a permanent interaction menu) to advance the events. Most of the choices are purely cosmetic, though a few might lead to Game Over.</synopsis>

    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Gokko Vol. 02 School Gal's</title>
      <synopsis>Gokko Vol. 02: School Gal's (sic) is very similar in structure to the  previous volume, but - as the title implies - with a different theme. The player controls a young male protagonist (default name Lance), who has spotted a beautiful girl near the gate of the prestigious Finlandia Girls High School. He is determined to gain access to the school, which is also attended by his sister. Though men are strictly prohibited from entering the school building, the hero is resourceful enough to find a way in; what happens afterwards should be clear to anyone familiar with the many high school-themed  bishoujo games...

The game plays very similarly to its predecessor, though the player has somewhat more freedom of choice and options this time. It walks a fine line between a "normal" Japanese-style adventure and visual novel, though due to lack of a fixed verb-based command menu it should probably belong to the latter. Most of the choices are there simply to try and see the responses; however, some of them lead to dead-end situations, which eventually result in Game Over.</synopsis>

      <title>Guernica</title>
      <synopsis>Long time ago, human passions caused the appearance of a monster tribe that has since become unwelcome in the human society. Years of bitter antagonism and violence followed as humans settled in the land of Galesnia. A thousand years later, a simple warrior named Grog enters a forest inhabited by monsters, and becomes gradually involved in a struggle that puts him in the forefront of the defense of Galesnia.

Guernica is a Japanese-style role-playing game with radically simplified gameplay mechanics. There is no party, no monetary system, and no equipment of any kind. Only bars and inns can be accessed in towns. The world map is completely linear, as the protagonist is only able to move on the roads and locations appear on it only when triggered by the plot. Much of the game consists of exploring hostile locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat that allows only physical attacks and usage of healing items that are randomly dropped by the foes. The game's cutscenes mostly depict explicit sexual encounters. </synopsis>

    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Gunblaze</title>
      <synopsis>The events of this game take place in London, in the second half of the 19th century. Mark Flint is a young private detective. One day he sees several men assault a young girl near his apartment. He saves the girl, only to discover that he has seen her face already on a wanted poster. But the girl (whose name is Jewel) explains that she is being hunted by the mysterious society of Rosenkreuz. Her father was a great scientist who knew how to make items out of pure ether; his zeppelin was attacked, and the Rosenkreuz are after the ether-made necklace Jewel is wearing. Mark, Jewel, and their friends have to find a way to defeat the Rosenkreuz and their leader, the ambitious Irene, who won't stop until the entire world is under her control...

GunBlaze plays like a story-driven Japanese RPG, with the real-world setting adding some unusual gameplay elements. Most of the game takes place in urban locations (such as the city of London); instead of a world map, there is a city map with locations marked on it. Despite the fantasy elements, the game tries to keep the realistic setting without supernatural or sci-fi themes - for example, there are no magic spells or any equivalent powers. The heroes fight with guns, for which they have to buy bullets, and which require re-loading during combat.

Otherwise, GunBlaze preserves traditional Japanese RPG gameplay elements such as linear plot progression, simple character development system (leveling up), random enemies, turn-based battle engine, etc.

Despite the historical European setting, GunBlaze has typically Japanese manga/anime-style character design. The game has nudity and sexual content, though it can be considered softcore.</synopsis>

  <game name="Hamlet">
    <id>167730</id>
    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Hamlet</title>
      <synopsis>Hamlet is a redacted version of the famous play of the same name by William Shakespeare and presented as an adventure with a cartoon style. In the kingdom of Denmark Claudius and his assistant Polonius kill the king and queen to seize the throne. It is decided that Polonius' daughter Ophelia should marry Claudius, but then Hamlet, the prince of Denmark, returns from a long journey. Before he has the chance to avenge his parents and free Ophelia, a man from the future on a research mission lands his space ship on Hamlet, accidentally killing him. Since Hamlet is out of the picture, the unknown man decides to become a hero and free Ophelia himself.

Loosely based on the events of the play, the player guides the man through five acts to free Ophelia from the clutches of Claudius. The overall story is more or less maintained, with familiar characters such as Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and Laertes, but Polonius for instance is a green man in a space suit. Using a humorous style the unknown man needs to solve many puzzles in a typical point-and-click adventure style. As it is aimed towards a casual audience, a number of typical elements is not present, such as a conversation system, an inventory, item combinations, or different actions. Each puzzle is set in a single scene where the player needs to click objects in the environment to manipulate them. Puzzles range from simple combinations to much harder challenges that require some trial and error, and sometimes quick reflexes. It is impossible for the main character to die. The main character can be clicked to see his thoughts and sometimes this is a requirement to solve a puzzle. When the solution to a scene has not been found after several minutes, a question mark appears to receive a hint.</synopsis>

      <title>Hana no Kioku</title>
      <synopsis>Hana no Kioku consists of five episodes, all of which can be accessed from the main menu, in no particular order:
The young school girl Chiko is taking a subway train and is sexually molested by what she thinks is a chihan (a person with the popular Japanese "hobby" of touching young girls on the trains). However, the chihan turns out to be a young girl named Kiko, who wears a rather elaborate disguise.

 An episode dedicated to another popular Japanese theme: tentacle sex. A young girl named Mei thinks about anime stories and brave heroes who defeat monsters; at that moment, she is sexually assaulted by a horribly-looking giant squid monster.

Mei is back in school, but this time she is not the player-controlled character; the latter is now a female teacher named Sumi, who has ordered Mei to stay in the classroom after the lesson, in order to have sex with her.

A school girl named Saki is sick and is lying on the bed in the school hospital. From that point, the story can branch two different ways: either she is being raped by Sumi, or seduced by the nurse Aki.

 Back to Kiko from the first story; she is the playable character now, and, depending on the story branch, she either waits for her boyfriend and has sex with him, or goes outside in a disguise already seen in the first episode mentioned.All the episodes are visual novels with very little interaction; the player is only allowed to make a few choices. However, the choices usually change the direction of the events significantly, up to the point of leading to completely different situations.</synopsis>

      <title>Himitsu no Hanazono</title>
      <synopsis>A high-school student named K?suke had a dream, in which he saw a beautiful woman talking to him. The next morning he found out that the new teacher looked very similar to the woman he saw. After overhearing a conversation, K?suke realizes that the new teacher is in fact a detective sent to investigate the murder of a female student that occurred in the gym. The young man has to play his cards right in order to become part of the investigation, solve the mystery, and perhaps impress the attractive teacher in other ways.

Himitsu no Hanazono is essentially a visual novel. There are no verb commands and no real interaction with the environment. The choices are rather frequent and fairly numerous (usually four or five choices at most screens). Most of these choices, however, do not affect the plot, though they may alter subsequent dialogue. The player is also able to navigate the protagonist on school grounds and inside the main building in a top-down fashion, visiting locations in any order.</synopsis>

      <title>Idol Project 2</title>
      <synopsis>Unlike the  first Idol Project, the story of the sequel is directly related to to the anime series Idol Project, starring the same characters, with the young and ambitious Mimu Emilton as the protagonist. Mimu finds herself on a tropical island, where she must rise to fame by winning contests and promoting her singing skills. Like in the previous game, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to exploring the top-down city, visiting various places, searching for necessary people and raising the protagonist's parameters. Mimu has a much more detailed set of parameters than the hero of the previous game, including physical attributes as well as popularity rankings. The RPG element has been further enhanced by introducing random character (crazed fans and alike) who would sometimes attack Mimu on the city map and other locations.

Like the anime, Idol Project 2 has somewhat sexy, but "cute" graphics, as opposed to the adult overtones of the predecessor.</synopsis>

      <title>If</title>
      <synopsis>IF contains four scenarios, which are unrelated to each other and can be accessed directly from the main menu:
 The first scenario stars a 19-year-old young man who accidentally makes a wish and summons a cute-looking female demon, who is ready to serve his "master"... in various ways, including what you just thought.

 This scenario is sub-titled Triangle, and is dedicated to a high-school student who has a rather uneasy relationship with the girl he likes. One day he meets a female childhood friend, which further complicates his love life...

 Set in medieval (feudal) Japan, the scenario tells the story of a young man who is on his way to the capital city, to study martial arts by a famous teacher. He gets sick and has to stay in a mountain village. Soon he notices that strange things begin to happen there, and has to find a way to release a woman from a curse that was placed on her.

 The last scenario is set in a small village that lies deep in a forest, in a fictional country, and focuses on a young boy named Indy. He fancies the daughter of the village elder; one day she is kidnapped by strangers, and Indy swears to rescue her.All the scenarios have the gameplay of a visual novel: the player reads the vast amount of text that accompanies the pictures, choosing actions or dialogue choices from time to time. The first two scenarios feature branching story and Game Over moments; the two others develop in a linear fashion and have only one ending.</synopsis>

      <title>If 2</title>
      <synopsis>IF 2 contains three separate scenarios (as opposed to four of the  previous game); they are numbered 5, 6, and 7 (continuing the count from the first IF), but have no relation story-wise either to the preceding scenarios or each other.
 "Scenario 5" is a rare example of "mainstream" eroge which deals with a male homosexual relationship. The adult content here is text-only; there are no graphics that depict explicit sex. The hero of the game is a young man who lives together with his boyfriend. A girl who works with him in the company seems fancy him, and the protagonist has to deal with her advances and his partner's jealousy, questioning his own orientation in progress.

 This scenario has a branching story line; the premise is that the hero, a college student, is desperate to find a date. The episode is dedicated only to one day of the hero's life; during this day, he must locate and convince a girl to have a date with him. Depending on the player's choices, the story develops in various different directions from there.

 The final, "seventh" scenario stars a female protagonist, a high-school student named Kumi. One night she dreams of her male classmate having a romantic relationship with her. Upon arriving in the school, however, she sees another girl obviously trying to seduce the man of her dreams. Will she be able to reclaim him for herself - and if so, by what means?..The gameplay in IF 2 is similar to that of the previous game, though the branching story line concept is somewhat deeper and more complicated. There are more choices to make, and they have a more significant impact on the development on the story. Particularly the second episode is notable for being more open-ended, but also unforgiving and leading to premature endings if the player doesn't choose the right things to do and/or to say. </synopsis>

      <title>If 3</title>
      <synopsis>Like its predecessors in the  series, IF 3 contains three scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be played directly from the main menu:
 The first episode, sub-titled Will for Suicide, is indeed about that: a person who tries to commit suicide. The scenario can be played in two different ways, from the point of view of either a male or female protagonist. reasons and circumstances of the suicide can also be chosen by the player. The scenario involves supernatural forces that change the fate of the heroes; however, the specific narrative is defined by the player.

 This episode is called Like a Magic Woman; the heroine is a beautiful young woman, contemplating about her future career and desire for money; at that moment, she is hit by a truck. Miraculously, she survives the accident, and is granted the magic ability of shape-shifting.

 The final episode is entitled Eday &amp; Magy (sic), which are the misspelled names "Eddie" and "Maggie". The setting is a fictional city in the USA called "Autumn City"; it is being governed by the powerful Chief Anderson, enjoying an era of stability and peace. But a criminal organization targets Eddie, a young half-Japanese police officer, and he receives the assignment to bring the villains to justice.The gameplay is visual novel-style; while the second and the third episodes feature few choices and the story develops more linearly (though some choices do influence the narrative as well), the first episode is more open-ended, also containing several premature endings that should be avoided.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Image consists of three short episodes; each episode, in its turn, contains two different scenarios. The two scenarios within each episode are similar to each other, featuring the same main female character, and sharing many of the scenes (mostly of sexual nature); however, the identity of the protagonist, the circumstances leading to the development of the story, the dialogue, and the commands required to choose in order to complete the scenario are different.

All the three episodes are rather minimalistic, featuring only the protagonist and the female character; the object is always to have sex with the latter. The first episode introduces a girl from the tennis club, the protagonist being either an older boy or a younger classmate. The second revolves around a female high school student who stays in the school after classes; the protagonist can be a male classmate or a male teacher. Finally, the third episode is dedicated to the lovely school nurse, with the protagonist taking two alternate routes to win her graces.

The gameplay usually involves selecting verbs from command menus with different options and sometimes vast sub-menus of objects. The sex scenes (and some others) are handled through a point-and-click interface, with the player selecting an appropriate command ("Look", "Touch", "Kiss", etc.), and clicking on an object on the screen to interact with. Many choices the player is able to make in the game are "wrong", leading to Game Over.</synopsis>

This time, the "victim" is a young innocent girl named Reiko Shirakawa. She attends an all-girl and has never had any real contact with men. Controlling the cunning professor, you must seduce Reiko by selecting correct choices that are presented to you at almost any given point, avoiding disturbances such as the ugly housekeeper in Reiko's house. </synopsis>

      <synopsis>You play "Professor" Hitosuji, well-known reputed tutor and teacher for his abilities in turning even the worst students into straight A stars...although it might be just a coincidence that all those girls happen to be very young and beautiful students. His "private tutoring skills" might be somewhat questionable, but it works.

In Immoral Study 2, the task at hand is to tutor one Yuko Ijima, the only daughter of a big time factory CEO. She's been slipping in her grades lately and her father called you to put her back on the right track again. Oh, she has a major attitude problem. Nothing you can't handle though.

Another linear hentai game where all you have to do is click on the mouse from beginning to end, which surprisingly is a very short game by the way (less than an hour). It does come with voice support and pretty nice animated graphics, although it is partially censored.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>For years, the days on the Earth belonged to human beings, while demonic creatures roamed the planet during the night. But humans have invented artificial illumination. In huge modern cities, nights became as bright as the days. Demons were deprived of their time on the Earth. So they decided to strike back. A powerful demonic warrior decides it's time to show the human who the bosses are... by having sex with young pretty girls in uniforms, of course!

The game is a very straight-forward, low-interaction collection of sexual scenes. Controlling the demonic lord, the player can choose which of the "uniformed" girls (school girl, police officer, nurse) is to be the first victim. The player can also choose the gender of the transformed demon, which naturally leads to different scenes. The interaction is confined to repeatedly selecting sexual actions until the next scene is triggered.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Intruder is a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a space ship, flies from left to right and shoots everything on the way; preferably without dying from collisions or enemy bullets. The standard gun shoots both forward and backwards and can be upgraded by collecting power ups on the way. The game uses a gravity system: the player always needs to counter steer st avoid crashing to the ground.

Regarding power ups, the player needs to look out for symbols which have negative effects and should be avoided. Points for the high score list are also handled through power ups and shooting enemies rewards no points. Collecting an extra gives an automatic boost in one direction. </synopsis>

      <synopsis>The world Irium is a world ruled by magic. One of the most powerful magicians of Irium, the young and lovely Seria, decided to pay a visit to the magic-less world which is our Earth. There, she met a young man; they fell in love, and had a child together. But Seria eventually had to return to Irium. The child, who was named Masaya, grew up on the Earth and turned to be a normal teenager, unaware of the magical powers sealed within him - until a messenger from Irium appears on the Earth and tells him that their world is in great trouble, and he is the only one who can save it...

Despite heavy amounts of text, dialogues, and an adventure-like interface (with a menu of verb commands) for all the locations except the dungeons, Irium is still a RPG in its core, more specifically a first-person dungeon crawler. The player controls a party consisting of Masaya and up to three female companions. The dungeons are identically-looking pseudo-3D mazes (with an auto-map), which have to be explored and safely traversed to reach the destination dictated by the story. Enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based. Some of the characters learn offensive and supportive magic, used in combat or outside of it. 

There are sex scenes in the game, all of them rather "softcore" (comparable to those seen in  Knight of Xentar or other  Elf games). The player has no control over their outcome, but has to select menu commands to advance.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Kenta is an ordinary Japanese teenager who enjoys his high school life. One day, he receives an anonymous letter, apparently from a girl, who says she likes him, and wants to meet him in an abandoned school building. However, upon arriving there, he finds that several of his classmates and teachers (mostly female) are there as well. When Kenta realizes they were lured there, it is already too late - they are locked in the building, unable to get out. Kenta must find a way to save his friends... but what if he can't save them all?..

Though a Japanese game, Isaku is a point-and-click adventure with inventory and puzzles, resembling Western adventures more than its compatriots gameplay-wise. The game is viewed from first-person perspective; while individual locations are presented as still images, the connecting corridors are done in pseudo-3D and can be physically navigated. 

Objects (and people) that can be interacted with are highlighted, offering one or more actions to perform. The gameplay mostly involves exploring the rooms and collecting the necessary information or items to unlock new areas. 

The player is also able to make decisions during the gameplay concerning Kenta's relationship with the various female characters. Depending on these decisions, Kenta will be able to become romantically involved with a girl of the player's choice.

The adult scenes in the game are very rare and occur only during the ending sequence, or in case Kenta allows one of the girls to be directly captured by the evil mastermind behind their imprisonment.</synopsis>

Two years later, he is back in that town; but shortly after having arrived, he is attacked on the street, and robbed of all his possessions. Now he has to get to the bottom of the mystery, but first he needs money. Since the town is big on mahjong tournaments, the hero decides to get his money back by playing that game, at the same time investigating the townspeople... in more than one way.

Jan Jaka Jan is a  mahjong game in its core, the majority of the gameplay dedicated to mahjong matches (two- as well as four-people) against a variety of opponents. The player can navigate the protagonist around the top-down town and enter various locations, which are viewed from first-person perspective. 

The player is also able to buy items to increase his parameters during mahjong matches and encounters of sexual nature.

Cut scenes occur before and after mahjong games, and many matches and other events are dictated by the story. Defeating a female mahjong opponent usually leads to cut scenes that depict nudity and sexual situations.</synopsis>

      <title>Jealousy</title>
      <synopsis>An ordinary Japanese young man named Fujibayashi Kotarou was playing a computer game at his friend's house. Upon returning home at night, he was approached by mobsters, who demanded money. With debts everywhere and without real means to earn money, Kotarou opts to work for a dubious night club manager as a host. He finds it hard to adjust to the new life style, which brings not only danger and violence, but also sexual experiences he hasn't even dreamed of before...

Jealousy can be classified as a visual novel, though the choices the player makes during the game tend to have little impact on the story progression, and are quite rare. Most of the game consists of text accompanied by pictures or (more rarely) animated scenes of sexual nature.</synopsis>

  <game name="Joker">

    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Joker</title>
      <synopsis>Joker is set in the time period commonly known as the "Old West" or "Wild West" in the United States of America. The protagonist of the game is a young man nicknamed Wild, who lives in a quiet Native American village. Years ago, the village was hit by something its inhabitants have since called "The Great Disaster". In order to seal the forces that caused the catastrophe, Wild's father sacrificed his own life. Now, the ceremonial day of the White Magic approaches. The youngest in the line of witches, a girl named Laura, must predict the future for the village and the world. For an unknown reason, Laura is unable to see into the future. Concerned, the village elder sends Wild on a mission to the nearby town, to find out what could cause this and if there is a way to prevent the Great Disaster from returning...

Joker is essentially a Japanese-style adventure, with strictly menu-based interface, still screens viewed from first-person perspective, and no real puzzles. However, the game offers more interaction possibilities and less linear progression than it is usually the case in comparable games. The player must explore the town and talk to its inhabitants in order to advance the story and get to the bottom of the mystery.

The game has scenes with nudity and rather mild depictions of sexual situations.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The game's hero, a young man named Otomegawa, encounter Chururu, a cheerful female magical creature, who accidentally curses him to become a woman. Only the princess of the Magic Land can lift the curse. The princess has been reborn as a human being and is currently living on the Earth. The problem is that as a human, she has no access to her magical powers that would help Otomegawa solve his predicament. Only a moment of true ecstasy (and since this is a  hentai game, we all know what it means) will awaken her true potential! Luckily, the princess also happens to be lesbian, which perfectly suits Otomegawa's current condition and the means necessary to achieve the goal...

JYB is structure like a Japanese-style adventure game, with menu-based interaction featuring omnipresent commands such as "Look", "Talk", "Think", etc. The locations are displayed as small interior images and character graphics super-imposed over the background of the city map. Most of the activity involves visiting different locations on the map, trying to figure out where the princess is and how to seduce her. Elements of "dating simulation" in form of money system and possibility to purchase items are also present.</synopsis>

      <title>Kaiketsu Nikki</title>
      <synopsis>Nikki, the hero of the game, is a cybernetically enhanced young man from the future. His "home time" is the beginning of 22th century; his home town is the international megalopolis Shinjuku City, part of the old Tokyo. Humanity prospers, living in pleasure, relying on incredible scientific achievements. One of them is the time machine. Nikki finds out than four young, attractive school girls from 1994 got involved into some sort of trouble. Using his time machine, Nikki ventures into the past, determined to save them... and expecting a lot of... err... gratitude in return!

Kaiketsu Nikki is an adventure game in essence, with features somewhat unusual for a Japanese representative of the genre. As in most Japanese adventures, the interaction is done via verb commands selected from the menu. The player clicks on an object, which bring up the menu with the commands. However, while there are still no real puzzles, the challenge lies in completing certain actions in time, in order to avoid time paradoxes while staying in the past. The player must explore thoroughly the rooms of the four girls and figure out a way to conquer them.</synopsis>

    <locale lang="EN">
      <title>Kankin</title>
      <synopsis>The year is 2197. In order to be able to compete with the leading powers of the world, Japan was urbanized, huge city areas covering the entire country. In these huge, soulless cities, crime thrives. Violence is part of everyday life. Female police agents Sagoto, Kikuno, and Chisame are sent to Koube City to arrest drug dealers. But all goes wrong in the very beginning, and the young women fall victims to vicious criminals. 

Kankin has none of the classic (since  Mokkoriman RPG)  Illusion gameplay elements, and is low on interactivity even compared to other Japanese adventures. The player's input is reduced to choosing available menu options. Wrong choices may sometimes lead to Game Over, but most of the time the player has to go through all the options several times to make the story advance. There is no character movement whatsoever in the game, and the characters from whose point of view the story is told change with each scene, and include other minor characters beside the three main heroines.

"Kankin" shares its dark futuristic setting and several characters (such as Kikuno and others) with other Illusion games, in particular its follow-up  Requiem Hurts: Kankin.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Karei naru Jinsei 2 is a board/dating simulation game, very similar to its  predecessor. As in the first game, players can compete against each other or against computer AI in an adult-themed board game, with the eventual goal of having sex with various female characters.

There are more girls and a larger variety of items to buy than in the first game. There are specialized shops (boutique, adult, etc.) which offer more items for sale. The basic gameplay is the same (each player starts a "roulette" which determines the amount of squares he can move on the board). However, an additional "event roulette" has been added, which resembles a slot machine. This roulette influences the player characters' parameters, money, etc.</synopsis>

Then he hears that Kawarazaki, a wealthy and powerful magnate, needs someone to take care of his mansion during his absence. When the boy arrives there, he is surprised to discover that the mansion is mostly populated by young attractive women - relatives, employees, maids, etc. Naturally, he is willing to concentrate on his job only inasmuch as it doesn't impede his advancements on the other "mission" - get friendly with every girl and... you know the drill. However, soon he begins to realize that something more sinister is going on in the mansion...

Kawarazakike no Ichizoku is a visual novel. The entire gameplay consists of occasional selection of a response and/or action from a menu. The rest of the game is dedicated to text accompanied by still pictures. Depending on the player's choices, different cutscenes will be triggered, and the player will achieve different endings, including several "bad" ones.</synopsis>

      <title>Kousoku Chojin</title>
      <synopsis>Haruki is a student at the prestigious private Morino High School, which he attends together with his beautiful sister, and where he leads the drama class. One day, Haruki discovers a strange toupee that transforms his body. Unbeknownst to him, he has gained special powers and comes into contact with a strange violent world that is hidden inside the school. Now he must understand what's truly going on there, at the same time trying to "score" with every girl he meets - be it student or teacher...

Kousoku Chojin plays like a cross between a "normal" Japanese-style adventure and a visual novel. The player has some freedom in choosing the locations he wants Haruki to visit, which triggers specific conversations and scenes. However, there is no other interaction with the game world beside this menu-based navigation - no possibility to actively examine objects, talk to people, etc. </synopsis>

      <title>Kurayami</title>
      <synopsis>On a cold Christmas night, the male hero of the game enters a large building, hoping to find a warm place. But the elevator he enters is malfunctioning. After a short while he finds himself trapped in the elevator, unable to get out. As his eyes adjust to the darkness, he realizes that a young woman is inside the elevator as well. The two must find a way out, and also learn about each other's lives in the process...

Kurayami (meaning "darkness") is a visual novel concentrating on dialogue and decision-making within the confined setting of a broken elevator and developing relationship between the hero and the young woman. Depending on the player's choices, their relationship will evolve in different ways, leading to different endings.

The game contains scenes with nudity and sexual situations.</synopsis>

      <title>Kuroneko Kan</title>
      <synopsis>The game's protagonist is a young man named Okita. His friend Murakami has recently found a part-time job: housework in the Kuroneko ("Black Cat") mansion, which belongs to a rich and mysterious family. However, since then, Okita hasn't received a word from his friend. Worried about this strange silence, Okita travels to the mansion. There, he finds out that Murakami has left. He decides to stay and investigate the suspicious circumstances. But he is not prepared to the assault of wild eroticism that the mansion's inhabitants will soon unleash on him...

Kuroneko-kan plays mostly like a visual novel, albeit with more choice prompts than it is usually the case in comparable games. The player is sometimes able to choose a location to visit; many other instances require him to choose the correct action and/or answer in order to view an additional scene, or avoid premature death.</synopsis>

      <title>Last Armageddon</title>
      <synopsis>The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.

Last Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic  Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.

Dungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.</synopsis>

      <title>Lemon Angel</title>
      <synopsis>The protagonist of Lemon Angel is Tomo, a high school student and one of the mahjong opponents in Mahjong Lemon Angel. This game however, has nothing to do with mahjong and plays - despite a rudimentary Japanese-style adventure verb interface - like a very basic visual novel, with right choices advancing the story and wrong ones leading to various Game Over situations. The plot involves Tomo meeting her friends Erika and Miki, only to become trapped in a magical dimension with her friends gone. Tomo must travel to various worlds in order to find them; these worlds have varied themes and settings, including an alien attack on a spaceship, a country populated by giant sexually abusive mushrooms, a realm that changes Tomo's gender, etc. Explicit sexual scenes occupy a large portion of the game.</synopsis>

      <title>Lipstick Adventure</title>
      <synopsis>In Lipstick Adventure, the player takes the role of Gorou, a young Japanese private detective. One day, a wealthy and powerful old man contacts him and asks him to find a box which - according to him - contained a family treasure. The young detective thinks that fortune has finally smiled to him, but when his pretty girlfriend Otomi disappears, he realizes that the mystery is bigger than he thought...

The game is a traditional Japanese adventure, with the usual first-person view and "Look - Talk - Think - Move" interface. There are no puzzles, and the game usually advances the plot when all the commands at a given screen are depleted, sometimes requiring to visit different locations several times.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>This is the second entry in  Lipstick Adventure series. Once again, the protagonist is the young private detective Gorou. One day his girlfriend Otomi introduces to him a customer, a man who calls himself Sakamoto. When Gorou meets him at the train station, Sakamoto hands him a suitcase, saying he should deliver it to his company in Osaka. However, the suitcase contains a bomb, and the poor Gorou is brought to police headquarters as a terrorist suspect...

Like the first game, Lipstick Adventure 2 is a detective/mystery Japanese-style adventure with comical and erotic elements. The player typically advances in the game by going through all the menu commands at a given screen. The commands are of a traditional "Look - Talk - Think - Move" variety, with sub-menus for object names.</synopsis>

      <title>Lipstick Adventure 3</title>
      <synopsis>This entry in the  Lipstick Adventure series continues the story of the young private detective Gorou and his sweetheart Otomi. After attending a friend's marriage ceremony, they return to Gorou's office and find a strange package in the flowers. The package contains pictures of Otomi and several other girls, her schoolmates, some of them naked. Gorou heads to Otomi's high school to begin the investigation, without realizing that he will soon become involved in a sinister conspiracy...

Lipstick Adventure 3 plays similarly to its predecessors, having typical Japanese adventure gameplay with menu-based verb commands. The interface has been slightly tweaked, allowing easier "triggering" of events by eliminating some unnecessary commands.

Like the previous games in the series, Lipstick Adventure 3 walks a fine line between adult and non-adult games, having graphical nudity and plenty of sexual innuendo, but no explicit sex scenes.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Love Phantom is a story about Akira Izayoi, a healer with supernatural powers, able to cure curses and demonic diseases, who also happens to be a big admirer of the opposite sex. This time, he finds out that the spirit of Lucretia, a French witch from 16th century, still exists, and must find and deal with it, aided by his pretty assistant and (also pretty) female witches, before an evil demonic organization beats him to it.

Love Phantom consists of a large amount of text accompanied by still pictures (mostly of sexual content). From time to time, the player is able to make a choice, which would change the following dialogue and unlock (or lock) CGs rather than alter the course of the story.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A long time ago, humans possessed unique power, that allowed them to create wonderful things and to build a highly advanced civilization. But it all ended when the chariots of the terrifying Death God attacked and destroyed the beautiful cities beyond the skies. Humans have lost their memories. And the magical powers from before started serving evil intentions...

Although a Japanese game,  Lunatic Dawn is much more similar to "old-school" Western RPGs than to its compatriots. For once, it is not a story-driven game. There are almost no scripted events, very few dialogues, etc. The overall theme of the game is quite abstract: the cities serve as places to buy equipment and learn combat techniques, but have no real locations (everything is accessed via a menu). 

The game is dedicated to character creation, RPG-style character development, and exploration. In the beginning, the player creates the playable character, choosing age, gender, and even weaknesses - all of which affect the character's parameters such as stamina, weapon technique, charisma, etc. Afterwards, the player allocates points into the remaining parameters. The player starts in a city and is absolutely free to go wherever he/she wants. There is a day/night cycle in the game. It is necessary to keep an eye on the character's stamina and buy food rations - the character can die of exhaustion and hunger. Random enemies appear on the world map and in dungeons. Battle screen is isometric and allows free movement. It is not necessary to choose a command for each turn: the battles evolve automatically until the player interrupts them with a new command.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Mahjong de Pon! is a strip mahjong game of the one-on-one variety. The player assumes the role of a male mahjong specialist who competes in an elite club against three young women. It is necessary to defeat them one by one, in a linear fashion. As soon as the opponent runs out of money (which happens immediately if the player manages to get the highest mahjong combination in a round) she removes an item of her clothing. The game has three difficulty levels and also includes a training mode that explains mahjong rules in detail and allows the player to practice with the guidance of a teacher.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In 1997, Tokyo was hit by an unseen disaster. Horrifying mutations turned the city into a ruin in a short time. All this was part of a plan concocted by supernatural creatures to bring about what they called a Demonic Destruction. However, a benevolent princess from the same magical realm contacts a simple young girl and tells her that she and other seven chosen humans may stop the catastrophe. Meanwhile, a young man named Gojou is captured by the authorities, but soon thereafter released into the desolate streets of Tokyo with a special mission...

Makyōden is an adventure game; it differs from the vast majority of its Japanese genre brethren by having a third-person view and navigation similar to those found in Western adventures. The interface consists of four icon commands (walk, look, talk, and use) that can be switched with the right mouse button, similarly to Sierra adventures. Despite this unusual feature, the game still resembles Japanese-style adventures in its core: there is no inventory and no puzzles, and the story is advanced simply by exploring areas and talking to characters.</synopsis>

      <title>Marginal Points</title>
      <synopsis>The Western kingdom of Endelunia is in grave danger. The forces of Darkness have invaded the country, threatening to conquer it completely and extinguish the power of Light. Princess Armantia appeals to the world's inhabitants to save the kingdom. Eventually, an unlikely hero joins forces with famous female warriors, and together they venture to drive the demonic invaders out of the country.

Marginal Points is a turn-based tactical game with rather simple mechanics. The player controls an army represented by several key characters, which act as unit leaders. The amount of soldiers in each unit is equivalent to individual character hit points. The player navigates the leaders through top-down environment, attacking enemies when they are in weapon range. The actual hostile encounter is displayed on a separate screen, and proceeds automatically. Extended cutscenes advance the story between battles. These scenes may feature dialogue options and even short one-screen point-and-click segments.</synopsis>

The basic principle is the same as in BattleShip: players position ships on a board and then take turns attacking enemy ships by guessing their location on the opponent's board. The game offers several types of ships as well as weapon variants with limited amounts of ammo and different damage properties. Erotic pictures serve as a reward for successfully defeating the opponent.</synopsis>

      <title>Mario Bros. Special</title>
      <synopsis>Mario Bros. Special is based on, but very different from, the original arcade game. Much like the original title, the action takes place on single screens, but the objective on each stage is no longer simply to kill all the enemies. There are four different screens, which cycle in order with increasing difficulty.

The first screen sees Mario attempting to reach the top of the screen through moving gaps; at the top of the screen are five switches, and if all five are active simultaneously, the exit gate will open. The second screen features trampolines, which Mario can use to stun enemies; kill all the enemies and an exit platform will appear. The third screen includes conveyor belts which can be used much like the trampolines to stun enemies; the goal here however is to collect money, and eventually a ring will appear at the top of the stage which must be collected. The fourth and final screen is a bonus screen filled with money; collect all the money before the time limit, and another ring will appear, giving bonus points.

Unlike the original game, Mario cannot stun enemies from beneath. Certain platforms, however, are unstable, and if Mario jumps on them they will stun any enemies also on the same platform. He can also stomp enemies if his aim is correct. There is both a single-player and a two-player simultaneous mode.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Masahito is a Japanese teenager who studies martial arts. However, instead of studying, he prefers to chase pretty girls. Finally, after a quarrel with his father, Masahito leaves his home. Accidentally, he bumps into Keiko Yashima, the principal of Yuai girls school. She tests Masahito in combat, and against all rules, accepts him as the only male student in the school. Naturally, our hero uses this opportunity to "get lucky" with his all-female school mates...

Martial Age is a Japanese-style adventure game. Most of the time here is spent depleting menu commands ("Look", "Talk", "Think", etc.) in every given location, exploring the school and getting acquainted with the girls. There is also turn-based combat in the game, but no statistics of any kind. The battles work like mini-games, which require the player to guess the "weak spots" of the girls, after which they give up and the hero can initiate a sexual scene.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A Japanese high-school student receives a letter from his sweetheart Mayumi, who has gone to study in a remote school as an exchange student. Something in the tone of the letter convinces the young man that Mayumi might be a trouble. He travels to her school, only to discover that Mayumi was kidnapped. Now it is up to him to investigate the school premises, talk to the personnel and other students, and rescue his beloved one.

Mayumi is a Japanese-style adventure. Interaction with the environment is performed by selecting verb commands that appear as icons surrounding the viewable area. These commands include the standard Look, Talk, Use, and Move, as well as the less common Hear and Hit. In some cases it is necessary to click on an object on the screen to interact with it after having selected a verb.</synopsis>

      <title>Merry Go Round</title>
      <synopsis>Merry Go Round is set in Yokohama, in year 2197. The city has turned into an international megalopolis, where crime prospers, and where justice is pursued by lone vigilante fighters. The hero of the story is a private detective named Brian. The first case is about an assault on a prostitute in the brothel "John Wayne". Further investigation reveals that the assault is connected to other cases, some of which involve dangerous biological experiments. With the help of the policewoman Akane, the bounty hunter Ridley, and others, Brian begins to gradually see the whole picture...

Merry Go Round consists mostly of still graphical images and plenty of text. The interaction is reduced to occasional choice-making. However, most of the choices don't influence the story, but simply lead to additional text description or picture. The game contains nudity and explicit sex scenes.</synopsis>

      <title>Metajo</title>
      <synopsis>Many years ago, in imperial Japan, advances in a mysterious science called "meta-topology" have led to the unexpected prosperity of the Heian era. A special university was founded by the scientists, where researches in bio- and nano-technology were conducted. Since women dominated society during that time, they were the ones imbued with the powers of meta-topology. A series of conflicts between reactionary governments and the "meta-women", as they began calling themselves, continued thousands years into the future. Led by Mayumi Tanaka, president of the astronomy department, a group of young women tries to protect their existence using their remarkable powers.

Metajo is a tactical role-playing game. The game consists of a series of large-scale battles, with cutscenes and dialogues advancing the story. The player controls a group of meta-women, navigating them over top-down battle area. The main characters are controlled by the players, while "nameless" units follow AI routines. Individual battles are displayed on separate screens, and are calculated according to the attributes of the participants. Leveling up occurs after having accumulated a sufficient amount of experience points.</synopsis>

      <title>Metal Eye 2</title>
      <synopsis>Metal Eye 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe and is closely related story-wise to the  first game. In the future, people have built the floating city Zeron, where the best scientists work on creating androids, artificial human beings who look the same way as real ones. Harvest Corporation is the biggest company that creates androids. The hero of the game is a scientist named Wirg, the father of the first game's protagonist. His work is to train the androids after they have been created. One day, the company building is attacked, and Wirg has to escape. He is saved by a nun and brought into a small town in the middle of wasteland, where his adventure begins.

The game mostly follows a traditional Japanese RPG template: Wirg and his companions (a party of three) explore the top-down world and fight random enemies in turn-based combat in first-person view. The pictures of enemies appear super-imposed on whatever location the characters are currently in, without separate battle screens. The towns have isometric perspective. Like its predecessor, the game has a large world map that consists of many separate screens, often including dungeon-like locations.</synopsis>

But then a traitor appeared, who has angered the Goddess with his selfish deeds. The balance was destroyed, the elements were no more in harmony, and the world plunged into chaos... 

Twelve thousand years later, a young knight named Eagle Windeed has been having a strange dream. Maybe there is still salvation for the human race. Maybe it is still possible to make peace with the higher beings. Eagle arrives at a tavern near the Tree Dungeon, determined to find out what his dream meant...

Mime is a dungeon crawler: the entire game is set in a maze-like dungeon environments (with auto-map). There are no "safe" areas; random enemies can pop out anywhere (the random encounter rate is however quite low). Eagle starts alone, but later in the game three other heroes join him. The battles are turn-based, utilizing the standard "attack/magic" formula. There are a few explicit sex scenes in the game.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The sequel to Mirage is set in the same world and features some recurrent characters, although the protagonist and the story are different. The main character is a young monster hunter named Etranze. He needs to slay a certain amount of monsters to reach a higher level, but meanwhile is struggling to be accepted among other heroes. This changes when he befriends Tree, Neat, and Lawn, the three lovely ladies who work (of all places) in the local church. Soon Etranze is summoned by queen Irene, who sends him on a quest to find a magical artifact that will save her kingdom from great peril.

Like its predecessor, Mirage 2 is a dungeon crawler. The dungeon exploration is done in 3D and is viewed from first-person perspective. Randomly appearing enemies must be defeated in turn-based combat. The player directly controls only Etranze in battle; his companion (the first one is Tree) is controlled by the AI, attacking or casting healing magic. 

Like the first game, Mirage 2 contains scenes with nudity, mild sexual situations, and pretty demonic female enemies who undress when defeated.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Long time ago, the Magic World and our world were not on good terms. But now, it has become different - or has it?.. In any case, a young spoiled boy named Frito, from a rich Magic World family, has to get married - and his father tells him to choose a spouse from our world. Frito's trusted servant, an elf-like creature named Fin, finds three suitable girls: a Japanese high-school student (naturally), a maid, and a Wild West farmer girl. Who will become the happy bride?..

Mischif (sic) is a Japanese adventure, with verb commands ("Look", "Talk", "Think", etc.), which usually have to be depleted to advance the story. It is possible to "tackle" the girls in any order. Once the player character becomes intimate with a girl, the game switches to a point-and-click interface with a variety of sexual commands. It is also possible to die in the game by selecting the wrong command in certain situations.</synopsis>

The humans had to re-build their civilization, and religion played an important part in the new world. A new religion, which claimed to be "the faith of love", began to spread through the world. Joe, a young and enthusiastic female knight and preacher, heads to a remote village in order to convert the non-believers to the new religion. But will her own faith be challenged when she discovers the truth about our world?..

Mission is a Japanese-style RPG, with most characteristic ingredients such as top-down world map navigation, linear story, simple combat mechanics, automatic leveling up, etc. Unlike most Japanese RPGs of the time, the enemies are visible walking on the world map and in dungeons; contact with enemies initiates a battle. A somewhat unusual feature is the necessity to choose participants (both enemy and player-controlled) before every battle, which then turns into a one-on-one turn-based fight.</synopsis>

      <title>Mokkoriman RPG</title>
      <synopsis>The hero of the game is a seemingly ordinary man named Kaneda Momezo. But in fact he is not an ordinary man at all, but a superhero called "Mokkoriman", a name which is derived from the Japanese word for the "splash!" sound usually associated with sex. Young girls have been kidnapped and turned into seductive, but deadly monsters, who kill people with lethal attacks called SEX. It's time for the Mokkoriman to show his true face! With the help of his two superhero-aiding pretty girls, Mokkoriman is out for justice, revenge, and mutual SEX.

Mokkoriman RPG mostly plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG, with world map, random turn-based battles, party management, levels, equipment, and everything else, albeit with a definite comedic undertone: the enemies are naked girls, regular attacks are called "sex" (with choices of one-on-one or group), instead of magic there is "dirty talk", and health is restored by reading Japanese porn magazines. 

The game is very heavy on explicit sexual content; even during regular battles the attacks are animated in a very suggestive way. The game marks the beginning of Illusion's career as the maker of interactive sex scenes. The sexual encounters in Mokkoriman RPG have their own gameplay, which involves manipulating the mouse to simulate the movements of the player character during intimate moments. Some of the sex scenes are animated, making the game a RPG pioneer in this field.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A young man wakes up and sees a young woman in front of him. She tells him that her name is Crith, and she is the village nurse. The young man tells her that his name is Graffy, and... but that's all he can remember. Just his name, and the name of his cute strange pet animal - Lippen. Crith says that he was found unconscious outside of the village. Graffy is naturally eager to restore his memory, but there is more pressing business: it appears that the gods are angry at the villagers, and demand a human sacrifice, which has to be Crith. Graffy is determined to protect the girl, but there is only one way: to descend into the gods' temples and to find out why they are angry...

Mug-R is a first-person dungeon crawler, the gameplay focusing on exploring and mapping (with an automap) the maze-like temples. The party of playable characters - Graffy, Crith, and Lippen - fight randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. they gain experience points and level up in standard RPG fashion. Other RPG elements are somewhat reduced: there are no magic spells at all, and item usage is limited. The game contains explicit sexual scenes.</synopsis>

      <title>Night Slave</title>
      <synopsis>A terrorist organization known as Slave Dog poses a threat to the entire world. Steel Fox is the name of an all-female special squad, highly trained in counter-terrorist combat. Assisting them is the independent, state-unbound corporation Neo Logic, which produces assault suits -basically giant robots with their own heavy weaponry, which can be navigated by a skillful pilot. The young female pilot Rei from the Steel Fox is sent on a decisive mission, codenamed "Night Slave" - an assault on the terrorist base.

Night Slave is a side-scrolling action game, influenced in setting and gameplay by the Assault Suits series. The player controls Rei in an armored robot, navigating her through hostile areas. The gameplay is heavy on shooting, the stages consisting mostly on fighting one's way through a level, fighting powerful enemies, mini-bosses and stage bosses.

The player finds power-ups of different categories. Some can restore Rei's health, protect her robot with a shield, etc.; others are used to upgrade main and secondary weapons. Weapons can "level up", depending on how many power-ups were spend to upgrade them. The player can choose when and how to spend the power-ups.  Weapons are selected before the beginning of each mission.

Extensive cutscenes and dialogues move the story forward between the missions of Night Slave. Some of the scenes feature explicit nudity and sexual situations.</synopsis>

      <title>Nostalgia 1907</title>
      <synopsis>Nostalgia 1907 is a visual novel that takes place in the year 1907 on board the ship "Nostalgia". While the ship was crossing the Atlantic ocean, an explosion damaged it. Taking the role of several characters, among them the ship's captain and a few passengers, the player has to find out who caused the explosion and why.

The game is mostly composed of text accompanying still pictures; the interaction is restricted to several occasions during which the player has to make choices for the character currently regarded as protagonist. The game's graphics are done entirely in sepia tones. Despite its Japanese origin, the hand-drawn graphics of Nostalgia 1907 eschew the usual manga-style aesthetics.</synopsis>

Nut Berry is a quiz game with strategy board game elements. The player character moves on a map according to a number randomly resulting from throwing dice. Each location leads to a short quiz proposed by a female character. Answering three questions correctly will win the "battle"; each wrong answer depletes the hero's HP. Special locations such as houses and castles contain young women who undress when the player answers a question correctly.</synopsis>

The player competes one-on-one against any of the six young women featured in the game. Each opponent offers a different thematic set of tiles (e.g. a stereotypical shy schoolgirl uses teddy bears, pink clothes, etc.), but the game rules are always the same: form simple combinations of three or more identical tiles to win. After each successful round the girl removed a part of her clothes.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Panic Bomber is a Tetris-style game set in the Bomberman universe.

The aim is to form a chain of 3 identical blocks to make them disappear. This causes bombs (not lit) to drop in your play field. These can only explode if you can place a lit bomb (which drops regularly from the top of the screen) close enough.

Doing well at this will fill your opponent's field with rubbish and make his life that much harder.</synopsis>

      <title>Panic Dolls</title>
      <synopsis>In Panic Dolls, three ordinary Japanese school girls suddenly discover that Miki, their school nurse, is in fact a "Master Dragoon", a super-heroine fighting for a powerful galactic organization. Their current adversary is the evil warlord Barado and his emissary, the sexy yet deadly monster-summoner Kyuuma. The three girls turn into the super-heroines Phoenix Rose, Tiger Lily, and Tortoise Cheery - the Power Dolls - and venture into Barado's dungeons to defeat him once and for all...

...only the player won't be helping them. In a sudden twist, the player is given control of the evil Kyuuma. The girls are automatically walking through the isometric, maze-like dungeons, trying to find the exit. The player's goal is to help Kyuuma summon monsters to stop them. As the girls walk, their attack level increases (from 0 to 4), and so does Kyuuma's summoning level. At level 4, she can summon the most powerful monsters in each category (giants, demons, spirits, etc.). When the monster is placed into the dungeon, it will try to find its way to the girls. Depending on the girls' level and the monster's level, the battle will decrease the girls' level by a certain number. The trick is to position different monsters in such a way that the girls will have to face a monster when they are all at level 0. Losing a battle at level 0 will cause a girl to become disoriented and wander off, turning into easier prey for the monsters, and eventually getting killed in a battle.

The game doesn't stop if the girls successfully traverse a dungeon. The player can simply let them walk and advance to the next dungeon screen. Depending on where and how the player disposes of the girls, the game ends with a different scene.

The game has cut-scenes with explicit sexual content.</synopsis>

      <title>Panorama Club</title>
      <synopsis>Panorama Club is a turn-based game with similarities to board games with adventure-like elements. There are four scenarios in the game, accessible directly from the main menu. The scenarios include a treasure hunt in a dungeon with traps, a polar rescue expedition, exploration of a modern apartment building, and saving various creatures in a fantasy environment. 

Each scenario has its own goal. The player character (different in each scenario) and the AI-controlled opponent take turns in moving over a map divided into fields. The objective is to attain the goal of the scenario before the opponent. Each scenario, however, involves repeated visits to the same fields to trigger events and advance the story, giving the game a light adventure-like flavor. 

Both the player character and the opponent have hit points, which can be reduced by stepping on fields with negative effects (such as hostile creatures, traps, etc.), but also replenished on other fields. Losing all hit points brings the character to square one. The game includes some scenes with explicit nudity.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In Paparazzo the player takes control of a young Japanese male journalist who works for an agency that primarily covers sports events. Dissatisfied with his position, the young man considers becoming a paparazzo, working on his own to get pictures of celebrities. From that point on the plot branches depending on the player's decisions, as the protagonist encounters various women and may pursue relationships with them.

Paparazzo is built like a visual novel. The scenes evolve automatically and the player's decisions are usually confined to choosing a location to visit. During the course of the game the protagonist may have relationship with many woman, including celebrities, colleagues, clients, a shop clerk, a high school student, etc. Ultimately it is the player's choice which woman the hero will stay with, leading to about ten independent endings.</synopsis>

Shinichi is then chosen to be the test subject of the new virtual reality device, participating in adventures where his sexual powers are tested above all.

Paradise Arena consists of four independent "virtual reality" scenarios, each dedicated to a particular theme as the protagonists visits a harem, enters an agency that promotes pop singers, is hired as a tutor, and travels to an airport. Each scenario consists almost entirely of seduction scenes that eventually lead to explicit sex scenes. The game plays similarly to visual novels, albeit with several choices during every scene. Rather than making one decision, the player has to repeatedly select options and check how they influence a counter that reports the woman's mood. When this counter reaches zero the game is over.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In the future, mankind successfully colonized Mars. However, the colonists eventually wished to be independent from Earth's control, and as a result a war began. Martian colonists used armored combat androids in battles. Eventually an uneasy truce was achieved, but Martian economy was badly damaged by war, and the planet became de facto dependent on Earth to survive.

Half a year later, a young Tokyo-based private investigator named Ry?ichi and his assistant, the android Leyla, are contacted by the colonel of the former colonial army of Mars. It appears that someone has stolen documents containing top military secrets and disappeared with them. Ry?ichi is asked to find that man, whom he knew quite well during the years of war...

Phobos is a Japanese-style adventure game. Every scene requires the player to select verb-object combination commands from a menu to examine locations, talk to people, and obtain information. Once the protagonist learns of a new location is becomes available in the menu. The player is usually free to visit all known locations and repeat conversations while searching for clues. Some scenes contain explicit erotic images.</synopsis>

      <title>Pink Shock Pirates II</title>
      <synopsis>After the brave pirate Pink has defeated the evil Temujin in the  first game, peace was restored in the land of Thanatos. However, demonic forces cannot be annihilated so easily; the spirit of Temujin is still alive, looking for a body to possess once the power of the seal that imprisons his soul is gone. The king of the land is concerned, particularly because Pink herself has disappeared, possibly abducted by Temujin's agents. The king summons four female knights under the command of Sara, and orders them to rescue Pink and stop the forces of evil once again.

Pink Shock Pirates II retains many gameplay elements of the original; however, rather than being a hybrid between two full-fledged genres (strategy and role-playing), it is more of an RPG with strategy elements. Instead of controlling Pink alone and hiring crew members, the player controls a standard RPG party (up to five characters). More gameplay time is now dedicated to exploring the land masses on foot, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style. Despite the drastically reduced amount of active combatants, the battles still have a strategic edge: the player has to position the five girls on the battle field and navigate them over it, attacking when an enemy is in range. The towns are now viewed from the same top-down view as the rest of the game, and can be physically explored.

Sea exploration and ship customization is still present in the sequel. It is no longer possible to fight with ship cannons; instead, the player can acquire multiple ships. From time to time, a whole armada of ships will attack the protagonists, which leads to turn-based battles that are played similarly to the regular ones, the combatants being represented as separate ships rather than individual characters. As in the first game, the enemies can decide to board the player-controlled ship; a battle with a larger number of combatants (including "nameless" crew members) ensues. </synopsis>

It includes the continuation of the sci-fi Japanese-style adventure Who Is There?, as well as a continuation of Halftime Lover, this time non-interactive. The simplified quiz game from the previous game returns as well.

This volume introduces four new mini-games. The first is a simple mini-adventure depicting a sexual relationship between a student and her teachers, male and female. The second is a Whac-A-Mole variant with various creatures popping out of the holes. The third mini-game involves rapidly pressing a key to align falling objects of different weight. Finally, the fourth game features descending heads (monkey, human, and a reptile monster) that have to be attached to the bodies below by quickly moving them around and turning them left and right.  The last two games award the player with erotic images, varying depending on the score achieved by the player.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Pink Sox 5 is a collection of adult-themed mini-games in various genres. It includes the continuation of the sci-fi adventure Who Is There, its story advancing towards darker themes, as well as a very short non-interactive episode of Halftime Lover.  The mini-adventure Balancing Beam of Love, depicting the sexual experiences of a school girl, continues in a slightly different format with a point-and-click interface.

The other mini-games are different from those included in the previous volumes. They are: a simple action game entitled Monkey-Mankey-Baby (sic), in which the player controls a monkey and must imitate the movements of a comical human character by pressing different keys; a simple (no betting) poker game where getting better combinations removes lines obscuring an erotic picture; and a board game named Adultic Time, in which the player has to position fitting items on a board to match a character (e.g. a GameBoy for a school boy) to defeat an AI-controlled opponent who is trying to do the same.</synopsis>

Another very simple Japanese-style adventure is an erotic variation on the Red Riding Hood tale. Finally, there is also a simple slot machine mini-game.</synopsis>

The non-interactive story Halftime Lover is concluded in this volume as well.

The only other mini-game in this installment is entitled Sim Girl. Rather than being a true simulation game, however, it is a simple arcade-style game where the player moves a paddle left and right, trying to connect with falling objects such as rocks, chunks of meat, Y chromosomes, etc. Depending on the type and the amount of objects caught the player is treated to view a picture of the creature that has evolved as a result.</synopsis>

      <title>Ponkan</title>
      <synopsis>Ponkan consists of three unrelated scenarios. In the first one a young private investigator attempts to unravel a sex-related conspiracy. The second scenario is set in medieval fantasy environment and focuses on two warrior sisters who got captured and thrown into a dungeon by monsters. Finally, the third scenario is dedicated to "sex fighting" between young women of various cultural backgrounds.

The gameplay is the same in all the scenarios, approaching the visual novel format, though with more choices than it is usually the case with comparable games. Rather than branching the storyline the choices serve simply to trigger new options and subsequently cutscenes, though some may lead to a premature end of the game.

The game largely consists of explicit sex scenes. A comic book-like behind-the-stage segment, extended introductions to other products by the same developer, and various art galleries are included.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In the year 2535 the planet Omni declared independence from Earth. This decision was met by harsh repressions carried out by the Terran government. In response, Omni scientists managed to convert a device known as Power Loader (PLD) into combat mechas. Five years later, the 177th squadron was formed, consisting of an all-female team named DoLLS (Detachment of Limited Line Service).

Power Dolls is a turn-based strategy game in which the player takes role of a commander of an all-female military group manning giant mechanized battlesuits in a series of nine missions, with objectives ranging from destroying convoys to stalling enemy advance to rescuing captured military personnel. 

Squads for each mission can be assembled from a total of twenty-one pilots, seven variants of mechanized battle armor (which can be armed with sixteen types of weaponry), four types of aircraft ranging from transport carriers to fighter-bombers and artillery units.

Several different battle plans can be chosen for most of the missions. The differences between these may range anywhere from a slight change of the deployment time up to and including a complete change of mission strategy.

Successfully completing a mission unlocks bonus piece of artwork depicting one of the women piloting the mechs ingame. There are nine of these graphics in total, one for each mission.</synopsis>

Like its predecessor, the game focuses on the war between the planets Omni and Earth. The player commands the all-female Detachment Of Limited Line Service ("Dolls") squad and can opt for going through the campaign in a linear fashion or directly select specific missions from the main menu.

The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous game, with some interface-related and customization additions (such as more detailed ways to outfit mechas). The player must build a team out of several available pilots, assigning a mecha or another type of craft (plane, mobile rocket-launcher, etc.) depending on the type of mission and its requirements. The player then proceeds to the actual mission, navigating squad members in turn-based fashion through a top-down area. Like in the first game, tactical considerations (pre-mission choices, positioning of team members, etc.) sometimes carry more weight than actual armed confrontations with the enemy.</synopsis>

      <title>Power Slave</title>
      <synopsis>Tetsuya is a rather ordinary Japanese teenager, who prefers hanging out with his sweetheart Rika than going to school. His passion are 3D video games. The newest game machine which allows the player to completely submerge into the virtual world, modeled according to his desires, has captured his heart. But one thing is strange: lately, Tetsuya keeps seeing himself as a killer and rapist. Dreams begin to haunt him. Is this just a side-effect of the game, or does he have a dark side he knows nothing about? Or maybe the game took him to another world, which will from now on become part of his life?..

The larger portion of Power Slave plays like a Japanese adventure, most of the gameplay being dedicated to choosing locations from the town map, triggering events and advancing the story. The omnipresent "Look - Talk - Move" menu appears at some locations. However, there are also several turn-based battles in the game. Those battles are always story-related, take place on an isometric screen, and are fought against a single enemy. Tetsuya can attack physically, defend, or spend two turns concentrating his spiritual energy in order to execute a special attack. The key to winning the battles lies in predicting the opponent's move, which can be deduced from their dialogue lines.

Power Slave has explicit sex scenes. Unlike in most other similar games, many of them are animated, using 2D anime-style graphics.</synopsis>

      <title>Premium</title>
      <synopsis>Premium consists of four scenarios, each one of which is dedicated entirely to sex (sometimes with a bit of conversation and very straight-forward seduction before). There is no real story, just a series of encounters of nameless protagonists with different types of young women. Each of the four scenarios is dedicated to a specific occupation, which are: school girl, maid, magician, and finally Buddhist nun. 

The gameplay is very simple; even though there are verb commands, they are always situation-specific, and the player can advance the game by going through the few commands to trigger the next scene, which makes Premium more of a visual novel than an adventure.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon is a 2D side-scrolling beat'em up, based on the anime/manga series Sailor Moon.  The game is comparable to Final Fight, or the previous Bish?jo Senshi Sailor Moon R game based on the same licence. One or two players can choose one out of five female characters: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mars and Sailor Jupiter. In typical genre fashion, the gameplay consists of advancing through the stages by fighting various standard enemies and bosses with punches, kicks and special moves. There is also a magic system, comparable  to Golden Axe, based on crystals. More crystals allow stronger attacks.</synopsis>

      <title>Princess Confusion</title>
      <synopsis>Gery is a 16-year old princess. One day, her father tells her about a tradition in their family: each time a princess turns sixteen, the king sends her to a tower, where she will remain locked until she solves all its puzzles and proves herself worthy of her royal title.

Princess Confusion is a puzzle game. It has two modes, Story and Game. In the Story mode, the princess has to complete the puzzle rooms in a specific order, while the Game mode allows the player to choose any of the available 24 levels.

Each level is a top-down room with a black hole and several balls marked with different letters scattered around. The goal of the game is to sink all the balls marked with the letter N into the hole. The only available action in the game is to push a ball; the princess can do it simply by simply walking near it and keep pressing the direction button.

Naturally, getting the N balls into the hole involves more than just pushing them; typically, they are inaccessible in their starting position. In order to move them into a spot from which the princess can push them, the player has to manipulate other balls. Balls marked U, D, R, and L (up, down, right, and left) change the gravity center of the level. When pushed into the black hole, they make all other balls roll into the corresponding direction. The princess herself loses the ability to walk in the opposite direction once the corresponding ball has been sunk. Balls marked B explode when the princess pushes them. The objective is to figure out the correct combination and order of moves (sometimes quite complex) to create appropriate conditions for sinking the N balls into the hole.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Princess Maker is the first of Gainax' "princess-raising simulation" game series.

You are a noble warrior who has just saved your kingdom from an invasion by the terrible Demon Lord. The grateful king offers you to choose any reward you wish for your brave deed. But instead of opting for half of the kingdom or the riches of the land, you ask the king for the permission to raise a poor little orphan girl named Maria. 

And so the game begins. You are the one who has to build Maria's future. Of course, you can do it in many ways. You can strive to make a real princess out of her, teach her good manners, study arts, to make her a brave fighter like yourself, or just a lazy bimbo who cares for nothing. Her destiny is in your hands!</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A hero saved the human race from utter annihilation by the gods. This same hero then was charged by the heavens to take care of young seed dropped from there. This seed becomes his daughter, and her guardian will be watching her progress.

In Princess Maker 2 the player assumes the role of a father to the blessed daughter of the heavens. For the next eight years, the hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing.

It is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game.

Mini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around  the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat.

The game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people. There are 74 unique endings in the game.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Princess Minerva is based on an anime of the same name. In the kingdom of Whistler, the best fighters are young, beautiful women, proficient in many styles of combat. Princess Minerva is one of them. She participates in a tournament, battles against the best female fighters of the country, and ultimately joins forces with them, building a super-powerful party that is bound to defeat the archenemy of the Queen of Whistler, the evil sorceress Dynastar.

The game begins where the girls are already united and are getting ready for the grand quest. Your party contains nine girls, each one with various statistics and magic spells. The large party is divided into three smaller ones, and you switch between them while participating in random battles and fighting bosses. The combat is turn-based, and is viewed from a top-down perspective, like the locations you visit. You travel on the overworld map, visit towns, and descend into dungeons. The three active girls in your party can also unite to perform combo attacks. </synopsis>

      <title>Puyo Puyo</title>
      <synopsis>Puyo Puyo is a falling pieces puzzle, with basic similarities to Tetris. Pairs of puyos (monsters from Compile's RPG series Mad? Monogatari)
fall down from the top into a cylinder. They can be moved left or right, rotated in either direction and made to drop faster. The goal is to get four puyos of the same color touching each other horizontally or vertically. Doing so removes them from the field. Making groups of larger than four, several at the same time or creating chain reactions nets more points. The game ends once the stacked puyos reach the top of the cylinder.

The game offers an endless single-player mode, a two-player mode (first player to fill their cylinder loses) and a mission mode. Mission mode presents the player with a number of pre-filled playing fields with a preset task, like making a minimum number of puyos disappear in one move, or removing all puyos of a certain color.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Queen of Tenshindo 95 is a hentai (adult) card game that plays almost the same way as the one known as 'Uno'. Each player is dealt seven cards, and the objective is to be the first who discards all in hand. You do so by matching cards either by colour or number with the card shown in the discard pile (and thus the card thrown is the next to be matched). There are also cards with special ?powers? that skip other players, change direction or force other players to draw additional cards, adding a somewhat strategical element. In the game you play against other four players (anime girls), and when winning you are presented with an interactive hentai scene. Each game consists of three rounds, the winner being the one who has more points (as the winner gets points based in the cards that opponents have in hand).</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Keisuke Murakawa is a teenager who used to have tender feelings towards his childhood friend Makoto Aizawa. However, they grew apart as each was busy with their own school life. Now, when both begin to attend the same high school, Keisuke is unsure whether she or any of the older attractive schoolmates is the love of his life.

Ribbon is a visual novel. The game requires the player to choose between two or more possible responses or actions during almost every scene, often multiple times. Going to certain locations or making different choices will branch the story. It is necessary to complete the initial scenario without getting a bad ending in order to proceed to the next chapter. The game focuses on dating and each branch of the story is dedicated to a particular female character. The game contains scenes with explicit sexual content.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>When an old man couldn't pay his debts to a sinister criminal organization, his eighteen-year-old daughter Aya was taken away by them and forced to participate in wrestling performances where young women must assault each other sexually in order to win.

The gameplay of Ring Out!! is similar to that of a visual novel, without verb-object interaction or any kind of movement. There are usually multiple choices per scene, but most of the times the player simply needs to go through them repeatedly to trigger the next event. The game consists almost entirely of explicit sex scenes.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The young private investigator Hiroshi Mus? has a troubled past involving amnesia and the death of the man he considered his father. He opened his office to pursue crime, aided by his lovely servant Medi. One day, a school girl calls Mus? and tells him her father has disappeared. The detective agrees to take the case and soon discovers a net of crime and corruption in the city.

Rose is a Japanese-style detective adventure. Most screens offer the player a menu with a selection of verbs, mostly including looking, talking, sometimes asking or taking, and a special command referring to a sexual act. Navigation is done by selecting locations from a menu as well. It is usually necessary to question every person about every topic, and visit locations multiple times to advance the story. The game has explicit sex scenes, some of which are animated.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The protagonist of the game is a high school student who has lost his parents in a car accident. Living with foster parents was difficult, and he decided to rent the room in the house that once belonged to his real parents, feeling that their spirits will become closer to him that way. However, shortly thereafter the boy started seeing strange dreams. Upon his arrival he discovered a jar in a hole underneath the floor in his room, and that jar miraculously produced a young woman named Ruri (which means "lapis lazuli"), who becomes a part of his life in a way he would never expect.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In this puzzle board game you should swap the tiles to make the sequence of tiles of the same color to eliminate them. Shape of tiles varies from big and small squares to triangles or hexagons. If tiles have no neighbor tiles you may take appropriate tiles from the pocket of the limited size to eliminate the rest of the tiles. Finishing the level, player will be transferred to the higher level if the results of the current level were high enough for such level. But to finish level successfully, player should acquire the certain number of points and to be qualified for the next level. The difficulty also raises and depends on quantity of colours, the shape of the tiles, and time limit presence. Undo moves are also present, but such moves decrease your final results. Game may be saved in progress and loaded later.

      <title>Satyr</title>
      <synopsis>The background story of Satyr is rather vague: the main character (default name Momojirou) is hired for two weeks to help a female gardener named Ayaka to grow flowers for celestial creatures - also female, young, and cute, though with elf-like ears and sometimes even wings. The goal here is to learn enough about different flowers, the ways to make them grow, and the preferences of the girls. 

The player is given exactly fourteen days of game time to accomplish this task. From the main screen it is possible to access information about flowers, check the weather conditions, talk to the girls (one time with each girl), then decide which flowers to plant. It is then possible to choose again with which girl to talk; sometimes they will ask different questions (about various topics, but mostly concerning flowers), and the answers will also influence their attitude towards the main character. Afterwards, a day of game time will pass. If the player is successful, the satisfied girls will pose naked, and eventually have sex with the hero.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>School Girls tells the story of Shinsuke, a young man looking for a teaching job. His uncle is the principal of a prestigious girls' high school, and he assigns to his nephew the job of a substitute art teacher. The rest of the plot is mostly dedicated to Shinsuke's relationships (sexual and otherwise) with the various female students and co-workers. The game allows no interaction besides choosing a location in the school to visit (office, gym, main gate, etc.). Going to specific locations triggers scenes that eventually advance the story. At certain points the player will also be prompted to make a choice regarding a context-specific action. Many of these choices, however, are purely cosmetic and do not affect the plot.</synopsis>

      <title>Sexpress</title>
      <synopsis>The protagonist of the game is a young Japanese man who is lucky enough to win a ride on the S-Express, a miraculous train connecting Australia with Canada and going  through almost the entire world with stops in Singapore, Japan, China, India, Israel, Russia, France, Ivory Coast, Brazil, Panama, and USA. Nearly the whole game is set on the train itself, with only a few locations accessible within. 

Sexpress is built like a visual novel, with the player's input entirely confined to selecting locations on the train, triggering scenes. Each such scene advances the time needed for the train to reach the next stop. The goal is to develop relationships with the several female characters onboard the train, and unlock as many sex scenes as possible with them. New girls board the train continuously as the journey advances. Failure to trigger a sufficient amount of scenes will end the trip (and the journey) prematurely before the final destination (Quebec) is reached. </synopsis>

      <title>Shangrlia</title>
      <synopsis>Tooru has always been a rather ordinary young man living in modern-day Japan. One day he was taking a stroll with his girlfriend and the two followed a strange cat to a mysterious castle. There, they met an old man who said he was Fermata, the court magician of the Kingdom of Nyuckel located in a parallel dimension where magic dominates over technology. A great war is taking place there. Erion, prince of Nyuckel, was cursed, and his soul transmigrated into Tooru's body. Taking the role of the prince, Tooru must command ten female officers and their armies and repel the invaders.

Shangrlia (sic) is a turn-based tactical game. The ten female commanders reside in the castle and can be approached in any order. Each of them transfers the player to a different location (alternating between urban, dungeon-like, and rural areas) where a tactical battle takes place. Every commander is responsible for a unit type in the army. These types include Lancers, Fighters, Swordsmen, Cannoneers, Horsemen, Archers, Mages, Ninjas, Dragon Riders, and Birds. Enemy forces possess the same unit types. Each type has advantages and disadvantages in terms of power, mobility, range, etc. The goal is to select and position units on the battle field, taking the conditions of the terrain, number of enemies, distance, etc. into consideration. Defending own castle and capturing that of the enemy is the top priority.

The battles then proceed in a turn-based fashion. Some unit types can attack from a distance, while others are restricted to fighting on adjacent squares. Battles are displayed as animated sequences on a separate screen, their outcome calculated according to the unit's properties and parameters. 

After each round of victory, the female general removes an item of her clothing. The final result for each general is an erotic picture with partial nudity and implicit sexual scene, but no explicit images.</synopsis>

      <title>Shangrlia 2</title>
      <synopsis>For a while peace was reigning in the magical Kingdom of Hyunckel. However, dark forces have emerged again. Commanding hellish creatures, they managed to capture the top female generals of the Hyunckel army, sealing them in special devices resembling eggs. Only three generals remained free, and they must liberate their companions and re-capture the land.

Shangrlia 2 is a turn-based tactical game and a sequel to Shangrlia. The goal of the game is to capture castles occupied by the enemy, freeing commanders on the way. Unlike in the first game, the player is no longer allowed to choose any battle right from the beginning and is at first restricted to only three battles. Same applies to characters and unit types: in the beginning the player can only control three types of fighters, and other characters are unlocked gradually.

There are fifteen unit types altogether (as opposed to ten in the previous game). New units include different types of horsemen, chariots, winged horses, golem commanders, etc. In addition, each unit comes in three variations, e.g. catapults and cannons are considered the same type, variants of which can be unlocked by completing battles and freeing them. Each unit gradually advances in strength, and must reach a "master" level to be actively selected by the player and positioned on the battle. This time, enemy units are mostly completely different and mainly consist of various monster types such as skeletons, minotaurs, dragons, undead mages, assorted hell creatures etc.

Winning battles gradually unlocks erotic pictures of the female generals. The sexual content is noticeably heavier than in the first game and includes non-traditional types of sex as well.</synopsis>

      <title>Shinc</title>
      <synopsis>The plot of Shinc is as simple as its title: the hero - aptly named Hero Narcissus - is a lone adventurer in search of a job. He arrives at a town which is populated mostly by young sexy women. The hero hasn't even enough money to visit the local brothel. Since the king hasn't asked him to rescue a princess (yet), his first quest, given to him by the pretty weapon shop owner, is to venture into a nearby cave, "Realm of Anguish", to defeat the monsters lurking there and retrieve valuable items. Naturally, this is just the beginning of a long career, which involves saving the kingdom and becoming a true hero.

The gameplay of Shinc is also very unpretentious: it's a first-person dungeon crawler with a basic combat system. Enemies pop up randomly, and the player inputs general commands ("Auto", "Offense", etc.) to deal with them in turn-based fashion. As per RPG rule, player characters gain experience points and money from fallen enemies, advancing in levels. In towns there is no physical movement, and interaction is done through command menu.

There are scenes with nudity and sexual situations in the game.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Yusuke Nagase is an ordinary Japanese teenager who goes to high school. Lately, however, he has been experiencing something quite out of ordinary: he would see dreams and visions full of violence and rape scenes. Yusuke doesn't understand what is happening to him. The only grown-up he trusts is his uncle, who works as a teacher in the same school. Every step he makes leads to potential danger, and Yusuke must be very careful as he attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery and separate dream from reality.

Shizuku is a visual novel. The game consists of still images (usually with photorealistic backgrounds and anime-style character graphics) with text superimposed on them. The player's interaction is confined to scrolling through the text and occasionally helping Yusuke to make a choice. Depending on these choices, the game's story might go in a different direction, or end prematurely.</synopsis>

      <title>Slayers</title>
      <synopsis>Slayers is based on an manga series of the same name (also known as Lina the Teenage Sorceress). The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina particularly likes money, and often robs rich people and hunts for treasure. She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and fight the bad guys. In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and find out who or what has attacked her.

The game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in Dragon Quest fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. There is no overworld character navigation; instead, the player selects locations on the map for instant travel. The game features anime-style cutscenes.</synopsis>

      <title>Sorcerian</title>
      <synopsis>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between  Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.

The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.</synopsis>

      <title>Star Platinum</title>
      <synopsis>High in the heavens, there was a girl who was training in a shrine to be the successor of a goddess. One day, the goddess had to leave the shrine to attend a meeting of the many gods, leaving the girl alone at the shrine. The goddess warned her to leave alone a box of star-souls within the shrine, and that under no circumstances should she open it. Naturally, as soon as the goddess had left, the girl's curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box.

The star-souls escaped, turned the girl into a small fairy, and fled down towards the Earth. She must track down and capture the star-souls, now causing mischief on Earth, before the goddess returns to the shrine. However, while chasing several of the star-souls through the sky, the girl crashes through the window of a young man who lives on Earth. She decides that since he can somehow see her, that he's going to help her out, and so the two of them begin their adventure.

Star Platinum is an erotic visual novel combined with a basic card game. The player reads through the story as it progresses, accompanied by still illustrations of the events as they unfold. Whenever a character in need of exorcising is encountered, the game switches to the battle mode. In the battle mode, the player and the computer take turns matching and collecting cards that feature various astrological symbols. If one collects enough cards of a certain type to create a set, then the player can attack, reducing the opponent's health by a set amount and resetting the cards to their neutral state.

If the player can deplete the opponent's health, then the story will continue and the player will be rewarded with increasingly erotic images of the opponent (which can be viewed again later through the main menu). However, if the player's health is depleted, then the battle must be started over again from the beginning.</synopsis>

      <title>Star Trap</title>
      <synopsis>Year is 2189, humanity has visited numerous galaxies due to the hyper-space engines. In search of adventure and exotics of the distant lands you have signed contract for 5 years with the Intergalactic Company to work on the Space Lines. For your first trip you were appointed as technician trainee on the freighter AMPELOS. The freighter left Achernar VI in direction of Tau Ceti II. Some hours later you were in the room of piloting when suddenly all alarms start... What is that? You have only 8 hours to discover it.

You start to explore the freighter AMPELOS. Robots became uncontrollable and attack you. They are surely behind the commander's death. Happily, the computer can help you to deactivate them. But your adventure is only beginning and already the cap of the dead commander (peace to his soul) reveal a number, which you remembers quickly.

The gameplay flows as the icon-based first-person adventure. You may move in available directions and do the actions via set of  icons, which are "Take", "Put", "Look at", "Examine", "Use", and some new such as "Listen", "Recharge" (a battery, a weapon). Another icon allows you to start a dialogue, for example, with the navigator or the doctor. You can then ask them simple questions from predefined words such as "HOW TO DEACTIVATE ROBOTS?" and you'll hear the words pronounced. At the right side of the screen you'll see the objects in your possessions and useful information: health, fatigue, your ammunition, your reservation of air (if you are wearing a combine suit). When you arrive in a place, you should use the icon to look at the place (the eye), sometimes several times to discover objects. Then (and before taking the object) you should use the magnifier on the object, because it can't be used on the object already put in inventory. 

Amstrad CPC version of the game is port of Atari ST version and use only 4 colours.</synopsis>

      <title>Steam Heart's</title>
      <synopsis>Steam Heart's is a 2D sci-fi vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with erotic content. The game takes place in the far future, on an alien planet dominated by seven elf-like or catgirl princesses that have fallen under the spell of a unique virus that has driven them mad and threatens to destroy the planet if all the rulers declare all-out war.

Only Blondia Varady (nicknamed "Blow") and his sister Fallandia have been spared from the disease and must pilot their fighter ships in order to penetrate deep into the domain of each princess, destroy their war machines, and administer the antidote. Fortunately for Blow, the antidote has been synthesized into his reproductive organ, so that means there is only one way to inoculate the girls....

The player controls the fighter ship through vertically scrolling stages, trying to destroy every ship that crosses its path and reach the end boss. The ship has a primary weapon that can be constantly upgraded by collecting power-ups, and a secondary slot for all sorts of collectible weapons that can be picked up in mid-air. The game features 2P-cooperative gameplay and cutscenes made of still images that explain the plot and depict the protagonist's encounters with each princess.</synopsis>

      <title>Super Battle Skin Panic</title>
      <synopsis>Arigawa is just an ordinary Japanese teenager, who attends an ordinary Japanese high school. At least he was ordinary until he met Mimi, the charming new exchange student. One day, being a perfect gentleman, Arigawa walked her home after the school, but was attacked by angry female martial artists. Mimi reveals to him that she has studied esoteric martial skills by a man known simply as "The Teacher". Unfortunately, not every one who knows these secret techniques uses them for the good. The young hero gets involved in a conflict from which there is no escape...

Super Battle Skin Panic is a hybrid of Japanese-style adventure and card-based battles. During the adventure part, the player clicks on one of the three available commands ("Look", "Talk", and "Move") to interact with the environment. As in most Japanese adventures, there is no puzzles or other kind of challenge, and at most screens the player simply has to deplete all the commands to proceed.

The battles are pre-set and follow a turn-based pattern. The player controls Mimi. Both player-controlled character and the enemy are dealt five cards, one of which the player has to "play"; after the turn is over, the player is dealt a new card. The cards work like battle command: attack, defense, etc. A special card is "undress", which, unsurprisingly, makes the character remove some of her clothes or even get completely naked. Both Mimi and the enemy have a "shame" meter, which can be reduced (or raised) by playing certain cards. The higher the shame meter, the more the character feels ashamed of her nudity, which leads to decrease in combat performance.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Super D.P.S. is the fifth entry in the  D.P.S./Dream Program System series. Like the other D.P.S. games, it is a collection of three short scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be played separately. Those scenarios are presented as cartridges played on a fictional console named Dream Program System. Each scenario allows the player to choose between two different protagonists, or two different personalities for the protagonist. All of the scenarios feature nudity and/or sexual situations.

The scenarios in this game include:

A rather disturbing tale entitled Maria and Kanpan, which focuses on a young female robot specialist who falls asleep and is sexually "explored" by one of the robots. The player can view the events from either the girl's or the robot's point of view.

An adventurous scenario, which depicts the dangers encountered by a young couple in a tropical forest populated by local tribes. The two are imprisoned and have to find a way to escape. The player can choose to control either the heroine or the hero.

A scenario with sci-fi elements, involving a famous female space pirate named Camelia, who raids a space ship together with her pretty lieutenant. The story varies according to the player's choice to control Camelia herself, or a male soldier on the ship who captures Camelia's lieutenant.

The gameplay is the same as in other D.P.S. games. At almost every screen, the player is given a number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are "neutral", having no effect on the progress, while a few are considered "bad" by the game, leading to Game Over. Scenes, dialogue choices, and story events may vary slightly or significantly, depending on the choice of character in the beginning of a scenario.</synopsis>

      <title>Suzaku</title>
      <synopsis>Suzaku is the youngest in the tribe of warriors of the country of Oomi, which has a long tradition of martial arts and magical powers. The old teacher sees to that Suzaku is training with the best warriors of the country, and the young hero's first true assignment consists of retrieving a magical mirror from a nearby mountain cave. Little does Suzaku know that a series of events will occur that will require the warriors to seek help from other countries, and together defeat the evil that is threatening the land...

Suzaku is an RPG with predominantly Japanese-style elements (linear gameplay, party of characters that are essential to the story, simple leveling system, etc.). There are towns in which player-controlled party can rest and shop; however, most of the gameplay takes place in pseudo-3D, first-person maze-like dungeons (with an auto-map feature). There is no "world map" to navigate. Enemies appear randomly and have to be dispatched in simple turn-based combat, by using physical attacks or magic.</synopsis>

      <title>SWAP</title>
      <synopsis>In this puzzle board game you should swap the tiles to make the sequence of tiles of the same color to eliminate them.
Shape of tiles varies from big and small squares to triangles or hexagons. If tiles have no neighbor tiles you may take appropriate tiles from the pocket of the limited size to eliminate the rest of the tiles. Finishing the level, player will be transferred to the higher level if the results of the current level were high enough for such level. But to finish level successfully, player should acquire the certain number of points and to be qualified for the next level. The difficulty also raises and depends on quantity of colours, the shape of the tiles, and time limit presence. Undo moves are also present, but such moves decrease your final results. Game may be saved in progress and loaded later. 

Best scores and levels will be written in High Score Table.</synopsis>

      <title>Sweet Angel</title>
      <synopsis>The player takes the role of Seisa, a bald-headed photographer. He likes sneaking into a high school and taking pictures of pretty girls. But one day he was caught and beaten by a girl who didn't want to be photographed. So Seisa plotted an elaborate revenge scheme: he managed to learn a spell that allowed him to look like different girls. Naturally, being one of the girls, it becomes much easier for our heroes to earn their trust - and to seduce them!

Sweet Angel differs from the majority of Japanese adventures by allowing the player to physically move in the game world (from top-down perspective). Most important conversations and seduction scenes are still viewed from the traditional first-person perspective, with menu choices for different actions.</synopsis>

      <title>Sword Dancer</title>
      <synopsis>It is said that the country of Suzaku is protected by the spirit of the legendary White Dragon, a mythical benevolent being. A young maiden known as "dragon sorceress" always resides in the temple. Her protectors are young men which are called "sword dancers". One night, the current dragon sorceress, a girl named Setsuna, was attacked by a horrifying monster. Her sword dancer, Hien, tried to save her; but the monster was stronger and flew away with the girl. The young hero swears to bring her back, restoring his honor and the peace in his country.

Sword Dancer has top-down navigation, linear story progression, automatic leveling up, and randomly appearing enemies, which effectively makes it a Japanese-style RPG; however, unlike in most other games of the genre, the battles here aren't turn-based. Taking place on small side-scrolling areas, the battles switch to action gameplay, with the hero being able to jump, duck, and execute different kinds of attacks.

Various characters will join the party, but the player can only control one at a time. Any character can be chosen to be the lead of the party, and hence the active character in battles.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A platform shooter from Japan, Thexder offers many levels and diverse enemies that gradually increase in difficulty. You pilot a Battletech-style robot capable of switching from a mech into a jet at any time. Your weapon auto-aims, but uses up a fixed amount of rechargeable energy; if you run out of this energy, you'll have to wait a few seconds before you can fire again. Your mech also contains a shield that can be activated to protect you from harm, but this lasts for a few seconds and uses up some of your life energy.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Crazy Park is a place not recommended for people who want to have a peaceful existence, because the murderers, thieves and other thugs converted it in their home. But of course, as in every other story where some bad guys take a place which doesn't belong to them, there will appear a guy ready to end with them.

Trigger is a first-person view game where you have to make use of your Gun Stick accessory. The game has a side scroll by which you will see a multitude of enemies emerging. Some of them will shot at you, others will launch grenades, knives... there will even be exhibitionists. But don't go too fast, there will be other persons to which you should not shot at, otherwise points would be reduced from your marker. Also, there will also appear some objects that will recharge your ammunition.</synopsis>

      <title>True Heart</title>
      <synopsis>True Heart is set in a medieval fantasy country Riku, and the player controls the young prince Gerard, the only heir to the throne. According to the country's tradition, every prince has to undergo a series of trials when he turns seventeen, to make sure that he would be a responsible ruler. However, our young hero is much more interested in other kind of "trials", those involving himself and members of the opposite sex. Surrounded by young and pretty girls of different social backgrounds and personality types, the prince has to find out which one holds the key to his heart... and not just his other body parts.

True Heart is a typical Japanese-style adventure, with a command menu including standard commands such as "Look", "Talk", "Think", etc. As in most Japanese adventures, there are no puzzles or other challenges of any kind; however, it is possible to unlock (or skip) certain scenes (mostly of sexual nature) by choosing to go to certain places at specific moments.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>As summer break rolls around, you, a college student, have decided to find the woman of your dreams! But, wait, who could it be? Maybe your childhood friend Mikae, athletic tomboy Chiemi, maybe even your teacher Miss Yumi? Who knows? But the only thing we do know is that now is your chance to find your true love!

True Love is a simulation of dating, with role-playing elements. You control a high school student looking for his true love. The goal of the game is to win the girls' hearts before your last summer of freedom is over. Every day when you wake up you plan your schedule for morning, afternoon and evening. Your choices (such as pleasure, sports, study, etc.) determine what special events will occur on that day (if any), and also raise your skills in the selected category. Different girls in the game (there are ten of them) have different interests, goals and preferences. If your skills in the category they find most important are high enough, you have a chance to get that girl into your bed.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>The protagonist of the game is assigned to supervise and lead a group known as Tuned Heart, which fights crime on city streets. The members of the group are all young and pretty girls, and also experts in firearms and vehicles. Mysterious mind-controlling criminals have appeared in America, and now cities are overrun by biker gangs and other criminals. It's time for the hero to assemble his group and show those criminals who is the boss!

Tuned Heart is a turn-based strategy game with strong RPG elements. Characters are moved around on vast top-down battle fields, attacking enemies with pistols and other weapons. Characters also receive experience points and gain levels, in a RPG fashion. Beside the usual weapon-related attributes, it is possible to customize the vehicles driven by the characters, and their strength can influence the outcome of battles.</synopsis>

      <title>Ura Mansion Hakkin</title>
      <synopsis>The protagonist of the game is an ordinary Japanese man who lives together with his pretty wife Harunako. Two years after their marriage, they decided to move into a mansion in the suburbs. Everything seems normal when the couple arrives. But very quickly they both become involved in sexual intrigues, and witness strange events - mostly of sexual nature - that occur in the presence of their neighbors. Looks like the quiet family life they were hoping for will never become reality...

Ura Mansion Hakkin is an adventure game with very limited interaction, which mostly plays like  "choose-your-adventure" book. The protagonist is automatically taken to different locations and through the story; however, many scenes offer the possibility to make a choice, selecting a corresponding command from the menu. Some of these choices just involve choosing different ways of sexual intercourse, while others propel the story into a different direction. The game is very heavy on explicit sexual content, the majority of its scenes being depictions of sexual encounters the hero witnesses or participates in. </synopsis>

      <title>Vain Dream</title>
      <synopsis>The age of peace has come to an end...

For many years, the inhabitants of the country Ellzeria enjoyed a peaceful, prosperous life, protected by the goddess Ell. But the island nation of Seljild, led by demonic warlocks, began to conquer one Ellzerian city after another. To protect Duma, the heart of the land, the knight Tristram fought valiantly, but was heavily wounded in battle. Mel, a young female magician from Asrafil, has tended to his wounds, and after three months Tristram is healthy again, ready to enter a decisive battle against the forces of Seljild.

Vain Dream is a RPG with traditionally Japanese emphasis on story and characters, as well as simple game mechanics and mostly linear progression. However, combat is handled differently in this game than in most other Japanese RPGs, and similarly to  Emerald Dragon (made by the same company); still turn-based, it allows free movement on the battle field, calculating the amount of turns without displaying them, thus creating an illusion of real-time battles. Enemies usually appear in groups and are visibly walking on screen in hostile locations.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Valentine Kiss is a dating simulation game, very similar to  Birthdays, only instead of "conquering" a girl as a birthday present, the goal here is to "score" on Valentine's Day. The actual gameplay is nearly identical to that of Birthdays, with a few interface changes and minor tweaks (for example, the game pauses automatically to remind the player of his alter ego's date). There are only four girls here, and the protagonist meets them right at the beginning, as opposed to Birthdays, where there were eight different girls met at different locations. There are, however, more detailed conversations with the girls, and some new choices during dates (such as holding hands, etc.). There are explicit sex scenes, but they only appear during the game's endings.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>Venus is a fairly simple dating simulation game. The player controls a man named Saeki who gets acquainted with four young women, three Japanese and one Western. Each girl has her own preferences as well as parameters that describe her feelings towards the protagonist. The goal is to raise these parameters (and ultimately the girls' "love level") by repeatedly going on dates. From time to time the player is required to make choices that would influence subsequent dating. There is an internal clock that is advanced every time the player character goes on a date. Successful dating results in explicit erotic scenes.</synopsis>

      <title>Viper BTR</title>
      <synopsis>Viper BTR is a direct sequel to the short story that was part of  Viper V-12, Magical Gambler. The original story was about a little girl named Ruri who received a magic wand from two dice-shaped familiars, and as a result turned into Chiyomi, a sexy gambling queen who abused her new powers to win money. In Viper BTR, the familiars return and give Ruri another chance to use her powers for good. However, she encounters Mai, another girl who underwent a similar transformation, thanks to her own familiar Domino. But unlike Ruri/Chiyomi, Mai uses her power for good. Will the heroine be able to join her or will envy and greed control her once again?

Viper BTR differs from other  Viper games by incorporating a new genre into the usual "choose-your-own-adventure" gameplay, namely mahjong. There is an obligatory mahjong match in the game that the heroine has to win, and also a special "mahjong mode", accessed from the main menu. The rest of the game consists of pictures with text as well as animated sequences; however, unlike in other Viper games, there is rudimentary navigation in "Viper BTR" (at certain points it is possible to choose a location to go to from a menu list). Also not quite typically for a Viper game, the story of "Viper BTR" is not composed entirely of pornographic scenes, and the sexual content is milder than in any other Viper game before.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>A "Pretty Girl Contest" is held, which is more than just a regular beauty competition: within a year, a young girl should become a star. Beauty matters, but so does skill. As the manager of one of the young girls who wants to participate in the contest, the player has to do everything in his/her power to attain the goal, and help the disciple reach stardom!

Virgin Dream is what is commonly called life simulation, a genre popularized by games such as the  Princess Maker series. The player manages the life of the young girl with a specific goal in mind, which must be chosen from the main menu. The girl can strive to become a singer, a photo model, a school teacher, etc. The player then tries to alter her statistics accordingly to achieve the goal.

The main activities on work days are divided into three groups: training, working, and learning. The learning category is the smallest one, but is also necessary for continuing the girl's normal school life. Training includes singing, arts, body building, sports, etc. Part-time jobs such as waitress, cook, private tutor, and even construction worker are available; the pay varies greatly, but so are the changes in parameters.

On holidays, the girl is able to venture outside and explore the top-down city, which contains various shops, boutiques, offices, etc. Clothes and other accessories can be purchased. It is also possible to talk and bond with other girls, potential rivals, who live in the same dormitory. All this influences the heroine's parameters, for good and for bad. </synopsis>

      <title>Words Worth</title>
      <synopsis>God had created the world with Light and Shadow completing each other, maintaining the balance of events. The Tribe of Light are humans, living on the surface; the Tribe of Shadow has many different creatures, who dwell underground. To sustain peace and harmony between the tribes, a huge stone tablet called Words Worth was erected.

But one day, someone has shattered the tablet. Both Tribes blamed each other and began a bloody war that has been raging for hundred years. Finally, the king of the Shadow Tribe sends his son, the brave Astral, to find out what really happened to the tablets, and to restore peace in the world.

Words Worth is primarily a first-person dungeon crawler. Even though there are a few "friendly" areas, such as a town where the hero can rest and buy supplies, most of the game is spent in dungeon-like, maze-like areas (with an auto-map feature). There is no party in the game: Astral has to face the enemies alone. The enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based. The game has scenes with nudity and sexual situations.</synopsis>

There are ten missions with different objective ranging from restoring power to a power plant, to 'seek and destroy' missions. The player can guide the tank freely across the over world, but there are enemy patrols that will open fire. The alternative is going though underground tunnels, where there are spots to replenish the tank and its weapons. The player only has a limited amount of time for each mission, and shielding for the tank. If either runs out, the game is over.</synopsis>

      <synopsis>In this game the player assumes the role of a space pilot named Darrian. One day, he receives a report from a nebula space station, from which he learns that nearby human colonies have been attacked by mysterious aliens known as Xenites. Darrian wastes no time, and sets off to protect the humans and stop the aliens.

Xenon is an overhead shooter, in which the player controls a vehicle that is able to transform into a tank or a plane. The transformation can be usually performed by player at any time, to combat particular enemies; however, during some sequences the player is forced to use a specific type of vehicle. During the tank gameplay, the player controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the tank in the direction of choice. 

The game features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where the tank can't shoot them). To combat these, the player needs to transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units. Upgrades can be taken from destroyed enemies.</synopsis>

In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.

Xevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided. </synopsis>

      <synopsis>You are a Skyfighter patrolling the airspace above the city Zenith as it's being built. Aliens are invading and your job is to shoot every single object above the city to prevent it from harm.

Zenith is a pseudo-3D space shooter similar to Horizon V gameplay-wise, the main difference being the player's ability to rotate the controlled ship left and right. </synopsis>
